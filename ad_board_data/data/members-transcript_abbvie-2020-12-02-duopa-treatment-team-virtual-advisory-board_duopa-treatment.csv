Can you expand more on your communication with the DuoConnect nurse case manager?  How often do you speak with her/him?  Do you setup specific time to talk with them?  Any advice on how you have adjusted to make this communication better?,I think those numbers are pretty low. It can all be brought up with the proper training. I worked closely with the DuoConnect nurse case manager to make sure all the pivotal information needed was in the notes I was submitting. I have a check list with the criteria needed for approval.

I would say that pretty much 100% of patients that actually get the tube at least start the therapy.

Regarding completeness of chart notes, I would guess this is less common at academic centers where we (mostly) have adequate staffing and resources to help with the insurance approval process. My guess is you are more likely to see incomplete documentation in community based practices where there may not be as much support staff or familiarity with prescribing specialty medications. I would also guess that practices that have an NP/PA involved in the Duopa prescribing process are more likely to submit complete documentation.",,,12/2/20 10:10

They have all the necessary hardware in clinic so that they can replace connectors and reinsert J tubes that have pulled out to a small degree.
