If you could give people a choice that would be optional.  I prefer electronic.  Paper is more concrete, something everyone is used to.  Electronic surveys are the best for me. Paper is too much to manage.  That depends on the patient population. I have elderly patients who would definitely want paper based, maybe a postage paid tri-fold they can complete, fold, seal and drop in the mail.  I prefer a short electronic survey because I can immediately return it.  See my answer to previous question :) Would recommend electronic for the vast majority of my patients.  Easier if electronic
