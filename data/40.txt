Without hesitation  I think that this type of advisory board was easy to participate in.  Nice that there was freedom to work around busy schedules.  I would be happy to participate in advisory board like this again, because it was very easy for me to do. I am more of an active listener than participator in group settings, so I think an online forum provides a better platform for me personally to express my ideas. As I mentioned earlier, I did miss the dialogue aspect of an in person adboard but obviously each environment has its pros and cons.  It was very interesting to see the different types of experiences others have had with the Duopa process. Our office has a very smooth process when it comes to enrolling new patients and if we can help other offices get to this point that would be great.  Of course!  Definitely!  If there is better technical support. Within 3 should take responsibility for their technical limitations in a simple thing like password reset. Shocking!  But I greatly prefer a real-time discussion either in person or over Zoom etc.
