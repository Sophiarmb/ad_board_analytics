I think you did a good job of introducing the platform.  It was user friendly and easy to navigate  I thought the 1-hour kick off was adequate.  It was very simple to utilize.  I felt the tutorial was more than sufficient. The alerts on the homepage also allow you to pick right back up where you left off in the conversation which is also helpful.    One of the challenges with busy physicians is ability to stay signed on for a longer period of time at a stretch. 
I faced a terrible problem getting back in because of a technical glitch that took 2 days to resolve. I was surprised that when a password reset is requested , the email link and directions would not show up in your inbox for a very long time , such that I had to make phone calls, talk to multiple people, attempts made by multiple people and finally a resolution to the problem literally ~ 5 hours before closure on a regular working day. Within 3 needs to do a better job at this.  The platform was easy to use.
