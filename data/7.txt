If I specifically ask them to complete a task they generally do.  If I asked them to fill out the survey and told them I was also filling one out the likelihood would increase.  I know I would comply and fill it out however patients who aren't computer savvy may not be able to.  I do believe that if  a patient really enjoyed the product they would want to thank you by giving their feedback in a survey.

I would fill it out because I know as a healthcare provider how important surveys are to understand the customer perspective.  Please see my previous comment regarding an enticement for completing the survey. That may enhance participation and completion rates.  As a professional and having participated in this process I feel like I am stakeholder and vested in providing feedback.  I don't think a patient is as likely because they don't feel as vested as I would because of participating in this process.  If it is short (&lt;5 questions) and had an online option, that significantly increases the likelihood of responses. For example, they could go to a website or scan a QR code to get the survey.  Some patients are great about giving feedback and others do not  @all is there anything else that you could suggest that would increase the likelihood of a patient completing the survey? The idea of a short survey and incentives are great. Thanks for the comments!
