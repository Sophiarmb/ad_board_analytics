I think this platform is a great alternative to in-person meetings during the pandemic. It is easy to use and understand.  Overall I think the platform works.  I liked that I could fit it in when my schedule allowed.  

I think that there should be a free forum for physicians to start a discussion on a specific issue or ask a specific question related to process that others on the board could help with.  I think the platform was very easy to use and it was convenient to be able to log on whenever rather than having to set aside a full or half day to participate in the advisory board. However, when I logged on I tended to chug through the questions, and since I was one of the first to answer many of the questions, I definitely missed the dialogue aspect of an in person advisory board.

Also, the email notifications were excessive, I would get about 10 per day :)  Super easy to use. The questions were straight forward. It was very simple to reply to others or to "tag" them in your comments. It was not at all time consuming.  Very helpful and also very insightful. I have learned a great deal from my colleagues and as always from our partners at AbbVie. More importantly I was able to incorporate logging into this platform without having to clear or adjust my schedule to make it for an in-person experience. I also feel that the conversations that are sometimes cut short due to time constraints were able to happen more fluidly without potential interruptions.  I enjoyed using this platform. I felt navigating the platform was easy and intuitive. I also thought it was nice that everyone had a chance to give their opinion.  Like  Dr Thakkar , I also believe that there are younger patients who would benefit from this therapy compared to DBS.  Good, but access was a challenge after password reset did not work for 2 days  The website is easy to use.  Some of the questions seemed redundant.
