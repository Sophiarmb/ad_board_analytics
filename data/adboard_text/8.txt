My answers would not change.  This is a great option for educating the providers who will teach patients about the importance of glycemic control and nutrition.  I think this is a good idea. It would ID those at highest risk. @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question. For those who commented that they would prefer that patients not be specifically identified by name, would you be amenable to including some sort of patient profile data such as age, medical conditions etc? This type of info may help identify who may be interested or benefit from the product. I think this is very complete.  I love the magnet and use it for other promotions with patients.  We instruct them to put it on the refrigerator to remind them of whatever is noted on the magnet. many people still have trouble with technology and I think we should offer a paper survey option or a phone survey option to folks.  I use tech apps with the over 65 year old population and some do very well but many still struggle.  No  I like the idea and the tools/resources like the magnet.  The coupons are also helpful.  No, all my prior responses would stay the same.  Receiving a nice package with items to try is a nice surprise for anyone.  I think having additional coupons in the kit enables a thankful customer to give coupons to others.  Well, I am not very fond of the magnet idea.  Not sure of where this is suppose to go.  Are we assuming everyone has older refrigerators that will hold magnets.  My parents have had stainless steel for years and we know SS does not hold magnets.  I really think we should incorporate technology with an app to order from, get coupons and notifications for reminders.  Susan 
I agree with Ashlyn's comments.  I also would like to add that I did not want to focus this comment on older individuals.  If we consider that over 85 millions people have pre diabetes that are 45 years and older, people that are over weight, physically inactive, have a relative with diabetes and low HDLs and triglycerides and much more would benefit from this product.  I think the  magnet is focused for the older generation and that is just a small subset of the individuals that would use it.  Most can set reminders on their smartphones. @all Great comment about the magnet and stainless steel refrigerator Lisa Jasper ! Do you think your older patients or others who may not typically embrace apps might be open to the app if it includes coupon, notifications etc? I agree that it's so important not to assume that someone might not embrace something new... even if they haven't used it before. If I was receiving this and reading it for the first time, it seems as though it is just a taste test.
Although the letter is to the point, what is the goal for the provider or patient to incorporate this into their meal plan?
We talked in earlier sessions about the benefits and who would benefit from this the most, but I think it would help to reiterate WHY someone would opt for this product and suggest HOW they can incorporate it and HOW it would benefit by it.
I also agree with Ashlyn Smith, PA that I would rather not share patient names.  This includes items I thought would be helpful for providers: the link, suggested usage etc.
BTW: I went to the site and sure enough: "Join now and save up to $18.*  You'll receive: Recipes and tips; Exclusive coupons; Dietitian support"
I also found the Health Professional page with the tab for resources, so it would be good to include that link on the provider kit (It may already be there, but some of the print is small, so I couldn't be sure)

I like the idea of 'try before you buy' so is it possible to include at least one sample for them to try before purchasing and maybe a coupon for free samples or more coupons after submitting the survey as an enticement for them to complete the survey.  I love this idea! I think you put yourself in the patient's shoes for a week and see what it is like to walk in the patients shoes for a week.  looks great  Overall I really like this idea. Clinicians and patients appreciate a "try it before you buy it opportunity." I would definitely hand these kits out to my patients. I would also like to hear their feedback--I wonder if there is a way to link each kit to a specific provider so we can see the pt feedback too! Obviously it would need to be HIPAA-protected but perhaps there could be a code that would send it back to the clinician like "Your patient said XYZ about the Glucerna trial." 

The only thing I would suggest changing is the "please identify 5 patients who would benefit." It sounds more like a chain letter than a great opportunity for patients. Consider "Enclosed are 5 patient kits to offer to patients you feel would be best served by this product."  Yes I would find that helpful. @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question. For those who commented that they would prefer that patients not be specifically identified by name, would you be amenable to including some sort of patient profile data such as age, medical conditions etc? This type of info may help identify who may be interested or benefit from the product. Overall this is good, including coupons and visual on the coupon. The message on the magnet is not as intuitive as the graphic on the coupon. Also I would not use a donut, but perhaps a perceived "healthy" option like a muffin or a breakfast sandwich.  I think the majority of invested patients would download an app, especially if there were incentives like coupons/samples. Then they will have access to ideas to help them keep on track, which the clinician and pt both appreciate. Consider a QR code to make getting the app that much easier.

There is a small subset of people who cannot/will not use a smart phone or download another app (I still get a few who say that they would rather buy a Libre reader or G6 receiver than use the apps).

If you want to try to capture every patient with different tech abilities/preferences, consider:
-Physical coupons/magnet
-App
-Website link
-Option to receive text notifications/offers 
-Customer service number 
*If all else fails, solicit help from a tech savvy grandchild or or niece/nephew by including on the pt kit verbiage like "You or a loved one can sign up on XYZ to receive exclusive coupons and tips." @all Great comment about the magnet and stainless steel refrigerator Lisa Jasper !

I agree that it's so important not to assume that someone might not embrace something new... even if they haven't used it before. I like this idea as well and agree with Ashlyn.  I wouldn't want to identify any patients.  I think this is good.  I like the magnet idea as a frequent reminder  @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question.

Ashlyn Smith, PA great comment on the "perceived healthy option"..... as most people "know" that a doughnut isn't healthy, but cake-like muffin may be thought of as a nutritious option.
