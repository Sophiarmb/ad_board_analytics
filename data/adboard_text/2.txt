If I reinforce the importance of using this product after the trial there is a higher likelihood of adherence.  It all depends on how they like the taste, how much it costs them when they go to purchase it and how the product makes them feel.  My best answer is it all depends.  Depends on availability at there local stores where they shop, cost and economic status.  I think the biggest obstacle may be cost, so anything that can alleviate that burden would be helpful.
Success may be in the 'eyes of the beholder' and their perceived benefit, so any way to track that may help to encourage continued use. It could be a protein tracker, the Dietician on the website for education, a touch-point follow up contact via mail/email/text - just some thoughts.  depends if they like the flavor and the cost is doable.  As we have seen with prescriptions, only about half of them are actually filled at the pharmacy and even fewer are actually taken. There are many reasons to this, including cost, patient motivation, proper instruction/education etc. There are many factors that make it hard to say yes or no to this question.  Depends on if they liked the taste and could afford it
