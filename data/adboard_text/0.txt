The kit is put together quite well .  Coupons for future trips to the store.    None that I can think of currently.  I would ask for referrals  on the welcome letter and have spaces on the survey to include names/emails of 5 other NPs/PAs  I think there should be extra coupons that they can pass on to their friends and family to challenge them to feel better and stay healthier.  A link to a site with suggested uses, the recipes we talked about in earlier sessions, the evidence-based resources etc. Perhaps a professional page and a separate one for patients.

I know it is generous to offer free product, however from a marketing standpoint, over the years, I have seen various companies include a thermal carrier or travel pouch for their products. I would envision for busy providers who can't take time for lunch or need something to sustain them during their long days, having a small soft-sided thermal carrier (with the Abbott Logo) that would fit into a purse, bag or coat pocket (and possibly include a re-usable cold pack) would be a time-saver so they don't have to take more time to forage for food or settle for less healthy options.  Just a thought!  Please see previous comment regarding one free 'Try before you buy' and an additional enticement to complete the survey.  coupons, recipes to enhance the use of glucerna  I like it and I think once again I love the idea of text message reminders that could also remind the patient to exercise.. Sort of approach it as an overall wellness app.  -Variety of flavors
-Recipe ideas  I think it is pretty comprehensive. The only thing I might consider adding is a single page to take back to their clinician with questions, barriers, and successes.  I would love the Ensure Max Protein and agree with Ashlyn- meal ideas, snack ideas, other sources of protein through food, etc  See previous recommendation
