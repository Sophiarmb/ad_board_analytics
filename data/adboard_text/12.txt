Routinely use  patient starter kits for an insulin pens with extra needles and directions for use with a fingerstick log.  None  I have not used any patient starter kits.  Please see my earlier response in the provider section. I mentioned that over the years other companies have included a thermal carrier or travel pouch for their products and I suggested an option for this starter kit. 
Also, a favorite of mine was a slide-rule calculator for Protein/CHO/Fats servings based on daily caloric intake. It was in a gestational DM pamphlet and made it very easy for patients to know how many servings and what to include with each meal. Perhaps something similar with the protein calculator Ashlyn had mentioned.  mostly glucometers, insulin pens with videos etc, glucose logs.  I have just primarily used samples and pt ed materials, but no specific kits. I will just tailor it to what the pt needs (eg pump options, carb counting books, protein examples, etc)  I have never used any kits before
