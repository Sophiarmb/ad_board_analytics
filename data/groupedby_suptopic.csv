0,Practitioner Experience & Education Kit Components,"The kit is put together quite well .    I would ask for referrals  on the welcome letter and have spaces on the survey to include names/emails of 5 other NPs/PAs  A link to a site with suggested uses, the recipes we talked about in earlier sessions, the evidence-based resources etc. Perhaps a professional page and a separate one for patients.

I know it is generous to offer free product, however from a marketing standpoint, over the years, I have seen various companies include a thermal carrier or travel pouch for their products. I would envision for busy providers who can’t take time for lunch or need something to sustain them during their long days, having a small soft-sided thermal carrier (with the Abbott Logo) that would fit into a purse, bag or coat pocket (and possibly include a re-usable cold pack) would be a time-saver so they don’t have to take more time to forage for food or settle for less healthy options.  Just a thought!  coupons, recipes to enhance the use of glucerna  -Variety of flavors
-Recipe ideas  I would love the Ensure Max Protein and agree with Ashlyn- meal ideas, snack ideas, other sources of protein through food, etc  My answers would not change.  This is a great option for educating the providers who will teach patients about the importance of glycemic control and nutrition.  I think this is a good idea. It would ID those at highest risk. @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question. For those who commented that they would prefer that patients not be specifically identified by name, would you be amenable to including some sort of patient profile data such as age, medical conditions etc? This type of info may help identify who may be interested or benefit from the product. No  No, all my prior responses would stay the same.  Receiving a nice package with items to try is a nice surprise for anyone.  I think having additional coupons in the kit enables a thankful customer to give coupons to others.  If I was receiving this and reading it for the first time, it seems as though it is just a taste test.
Although the letter is to the point, what is the goal for the provider or patient to incorporate this into their meal plan?
We talked in earlier sessions about the benefits and who would benefit from this the most, but I think it would help to reiterate WHY someone would opt for this product and suggest HOW they can incorporate it and HOW it would benefit by it.
I also agree with Ashlyn Smith, PA that I would rather not share patient names.  I love this idea! I think you put yourself in the patient's shoes for a week and see what it is like to walk in the patients shoes for a week.  Overall I really like this idea. Clinicians and patients appreciate a ""try it before you buy it opportunity."" I would definitely hand these kits out to my patients. I would also like to hear their feedback--I wonder if there is a way to link each kit to a specific provider so we can see the pt feedback too! Obviously it would need to be HIPAA-protected but perhaps there could be a code that would send it back to the clinician like ""Your patient said XYZ about the Glucerna trial."" 

The only thing I would suggest changing is the ""please identify 5 patients who would benefit."" It sounds more like a chain letter than a great opportunity for patients. Consider ""Enclosed are 5 patient kits to offer to patients you feel would be best served by this product.""  Yes I would find that helpful. @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question. For those who commented that they would prefer that patients not be specifically identified by name, would you be amenable to including some sort of patient profile data such as age, medical conditions etc? This type of info may help identify who may be interested or benefit from the product. I like this idea as well and agree with Ashlyn.  I wouldn't want to identify any patients.  @all thanks so much for your thoughtful comments for this question.

Consider ""Enclosed are 5 patient kits to offer to patients you feel would be best served by this product."" This kit is complete and helpful to the provider who needs to use it.  None at this time.  Just to put in additional coupons and ask for referrals and ask them to challenge their family and friends to try the product to lose weight and stay healthy.  Please see previous comments.  I think the materials are succinct and self explanatory. I agree with Lisa Jasper, RN, DNP, MSN, FNP, MBA that coupons are always helpful.  See previous question in this section. No new comments :)  I think it is adequate and simple enough that people would utilize all the materials "
1,Patient Kit Components,"Coupons for future trips to the store.  None that I can think of currently.  I think there should be extra coupons that they can pass on to their friends and family to challenge them to feel better and stay healthier.  Please see previous comment regarding one free 'Try before you buy' and an additional enticement to complete the survey.  I like it and I think once again I love the idea of text message reminders that could also remind the patient to exercise.. Sort of approach it as an overall wellness app.  I think it is pretty comprehensive. The only thing I might consider adding is a single page to take back to their clinician with questions, barriers, and successes.  See previous recommendation  I think this is very complete.  I love the magnet and use it for other promotions with patients.  We instruct them to put it on the refrigerator to remind them of whatever is noted on the magnet. many people still have trouble with technology and I think we should offer a paper survey option or a phone survey option to folks.  I use tech apps with the over 65 year old population and some do very well but many still struggle.  I like the idea and the tools/resources like the magnet.  The coupons are also helpful.  Well, I am not very fond of the magnet idea.  Not sure of where this is suppose to go.  Are we assuming everyone has older refrigerators that will hold magnets.  My parents have had stainless steel for years and we know SS does not hold magnets.  I really think we should incorporate technology with an app to order from, get coupons and notifications for reminders.  Susan 
I agree with Ashlyn's comments.  I also would like to add that I did not want to focus this comment on older individuals.  If we consider that over 85 millions people have pre diabetes that are 45 years and older, people that are over weight, physically inactive, have a relative with diabetes and low HDLs and triglycerides and much more would benefit from this product.  I think the  magnet is focused for the older generation and that is just a small subset of the individuals that would use it.  Most can set reminders on their smartphones. @all Great comment about the magnet and stainless steel refrigerator Lisa Jasper ! Do you think your older patients or others who may not typically embrace apps might be open to the app if it includes coupon, notifications etc? I agree that it's so important not to assume that someone might not embrace something new... even if they haven't used it before. This includes items I thought would be helpful for providers: the link, suggested usage etc.
BTW: I went to the site and sure enough: ""Join now and save up to $18.*  You’ll receive: Recipes and tips; Exclusive coupons; Dietitian support""
I also found the Health Professional page with the tab for resources, so it would be good to include that link on the provider kit (It may already be there, but some of the print is small, so I couldn't be sure)

I like the idea of 'try before you buy' so is it possible to include at least one sample for them to try before purchasing and maybe a coupon for free samples or more coupons after submitting the survey as an enticement for them to complete the survey.  looks great  Overall this is good, including coupons and visual on the coupon. The message on the magnet is not as intuitive as the graphic on the coupon. Also I would not use a donut, but perhaps a perceived ""healthy"" option like a muffin or a breakfast sandwich.  I think the majority of invested patients would download an app, especially if there were incentives like coupons/samples. Then they will have access to ideas to help them keep on track, which the clinician and pt both appreciate. Consider a QR code to make getting the app that much easier.

There is a small subset of people who cannot/will not use a smart phone or download another app (I still get a few who say that they would rather buy a Libre reader or G6 receiver than use the apps).

If you want to try to capture every patient with different tech abilities/preferences, consider:
-Physical coupons/magnet
-App
-Website link
-Option to receive text notifications/offers 
-Customer service number 
*If all else fails, solicit help from a tech savvy grandchild or or niece/nephew by including on the pt kit verbiage like ""You or a loved one can sign up on XYZ to receive exclusive coupons and tips."" @all Great comment about the magnet and stainless steel refrigerator Lisa Jasper !

I like the magnet idea as a frequent reminder  Ashlyn Smith, PA great comment on the ""perceived healthy option""..... as most people ""know"" that a doughnut isn't healthy, but cake-like muffin may be thought of as a nutritious option.

I agree with others that an electronic survey may be too cumbersome or scare some of the older generation away from offering feedback.  See previous comments  I really like the packaging. Is it saying that one drink is equal to a half of bagel?  Please see previous comments.  I think a text message reminders to drink you Glucerna each day! A website for patients to sign up for recipes and diet ideas as well as text message.  See previous comments--nothing further.  Same as previous "
14,Kit Development Brainstorming,"I prefer to form my own judgement and feel a rep is biased.  I understand their job is to sell but if I think the product has value I will use it.  Either way I am likely to sign up for a kit.  Just from my personal perspective I look at my email very frequently and I like free things. So with that in mind if the email stress ed that there was no obligation to purchase and it did not require a credit card I would sign up.  I agree, we receive too many emails already.
Please see my previous comments of how a rep can assist with the provider kit.  I can take time with the emails and they are flexible to fit my schedule  Again, we get so many email and mail request that it often becomes white noise and may be perceived as spam. It would increase utilization to have an in-person delivery to briefly explain the kit and purpose, to address any initial questions, and to be a point of contact for future questions.  We all get so many emails throughout the day. If an email is not from an individual that I recognize or have a compelling subject line, I will often delete it without reading it. To prevent that, I would recommend either a quick in person heads up from the local rep to look out for an email with details (vs a sit down in person demo of the kit) or have the email come directly from someone that the clinician knows. @all For those who would only sign up for the patient-kit via a face-to-face visit, is there anything that could be done to improve the e-mail communication that would make it more useful or in tune with your needs? 
Because of your time constraints, are there specific circumstances in which the e mail sign up might be more time efficient than an in-person meeting with a rep? Your thoughts are greatly appreciated!

If I reinforce the importance of using this product after the trial there is a higher likelihood of adherence.  It all depends on how they like the taste, how much it costs them when they go to purchase it and how the product makes them feel.  My best answer is it all depends.  Depends on availability at there local stores where they shop, cost and economic status.  I think the biggest obstacle may be cost, so anything that can alleviate that burden would be helpful.
Success may be in the 'eyes of the beholder' and their perceived benefit, so any way to track that may help to encourage continued use. It could be a protein tracker, the Dietician on the website for education, a touch-point follow up contact via mail/email/text - just some thoughts.  depends if they like the flavor and the cost is doable.  As we have seen with prescriptions, only about half of them are actually filled at the pharmacy and even fewer are actually taken. There are many reasons to this, including cost, patient motivation, proper instruction/education etc. There are many factors that make it hard to say yes or no to this question.  Depends on if they liked the taste and could afford it  The patient not only get the instructions for use,  tool for logging fingersticks but a few free needles for the pen.  They act like they hit the jackpot.  I have never used starter kits with patient.  Yes any type of kits are great.  To me a kit represents that it contains everything in it to make you successful.  I believe it's a receipt for success.  However they have to be message to the patient the right way.  It does depend on the product and very patient-dependent.  A starter kit allows the patient to get comfortable with the use of the product and allows them to see what they need for daily use because it is all right there for them.  Depends on the product and the patient but in general I think they help with success, at least initially. Follow-through and long term success is always a challenge. Perhaps it would be helpful to have the patients include their information and there could be a touch point at 3 and 6 months later from Abbott.  Depends on the patient  If I specifically ask them to complete a task they generally do.  If I asked them to fill out the survey and told them I was also filling one out the likelihood would increase.  I know I would comply and fill it out however patients who aren't computer savvy may not be able to.  I do believe that if  a patient really enjoyed the product they would want to thank you by giving their feedback in a survey.

I would fill it out because I know as a healthcare provider how important surveys are to understand the customer perspective.  Please see my previous comment regarding an enticement for completing the survey. That may enhance participation and completion rates.  As a professional and having participated in this process I feel like I am stakeholder and vested in providing feedback.  I don't think a patient is as likely because they don't feel as vested as I would because of participating in this process.  If it is short (&lt;5 questions) and had an online option, that significantly increases the likelihood of responses. For example, they could go to a website or scan a QR code to get the survey.  Some patients are great about giving feedback and others do not  @all is there anything else that you could suggest that would increase the likelihood of a patient completing the survey? The idea of a short survey and incentives are great. Thanks for the comments!  I prefer obtaining the kit and explaining it to my patient to increase buy in.  This ensures the right person is getting the right product.  This is a difficult question because I believe it should just be deliver to the patient's home.  There is limited capacity in the medical practices to have packages delivered there.  There is a chance for things to get misplaced or lost. I would order the patient kit while they are at their office visit and let them know to expect it.  With time constraints, it would meet a need for a provider to have all the information presented succinctly, with key points and the key pieces (i.e. evidence based research resources) explained so providers don't have to sift through the information. Once providers know what to look for and where to find it, it makes explaining and recommending a product much simpler.....and simple is better:)  Sometimes the only way rep can get time with the providers in our office is to actually come for a lunch.  I think personalizing the addresses is crucial. Once the provider has received the kits I think it would be great to meet with the Rep for any questions. Yes in my office my MA sorts the mail and she would probably automatically unpack it and put it with our samples Mail like this often gets processed and put away without a clinicians direct involvement as it does with samples and pt ed materials. Plus, a direct rep contact putting it into context and answering initial questions significantly increases the likelihood a clinician will remember and use it.  Mailed items sometimes get lost  Yes in my office my MA sorts the mail and she would probably automatically unpack it and put it with our samples Thanks so much for your comments Ashlyn Smith .  @all Do you think it might make a difference if patient kit was mailed, but addressed to a specific clinician? Would that make it more personalized?
Good point about the reps ability to put everything into context/answer questions. What if a letter was included with the reps info encouraging a follow-up call to answer questions or schedule a meeting after the kit was utilized?

Thanks so much for your reply Maria Lena Walls, NP :) Yes in my office my MA sorts the mail and she would probably automatically unpack it and put it with our samples Exercises using a stationary bike, example of portion review using the plate method.  Extra coupons would help maintain sustainability.  I like the exercise idea, and also maybe a brief overview of the basics of diabetes and healthy eating such as appropriate carbohydrate amounts for snacks/meals.  Extra coupons and maybe a card with exercises on it to follow after drinking a supplement.  Well, any type of exercises to encourage increasing their activity will help with weight lose. Ex. Exercises that can be done in a chair, walking for 15 minutes or a floor exercise. Lisa Jasper can you please expand on what you mean by exercises? I like Maria Lena Walls, NP idea of daily recommended protein amounts so patients can see if/when they are deficient and Ashlyn Smith, PA idea of including the protein calculator tool. I couldn't find either on the website, so perhaps include them there and direct the patients on where to find them.  I think calorie controlled, a lot of people are looking for healthy low carb options, the food should not have to require refrigeration.  web site sign up, for reminders and also could text coupons for the patient as they document (via development of an app similar to MyFitnessPal) their progress, ie, drinking the glucerna daily (via documentation in the app). they can receive rewards, i.e., coupons.  The components that are currently there, the page to take to the clinician from my response to the last question, and the protein calculator tool Abbott has.  Variety of flavors, other food protein option ideas, daily recommended protein amounts  Lisa Jasper, RN, DNP, MSN, FNP, MBA can you please expand on what you mean by exercises?

Much appreciated :) Well, any type of exercises to encourage increasing their activity will help with weight lose. Ex. Exercises that can be done in a chair, walking for 15 minutes or a floor exercise. Routinely use  patient starter kits for an insulin pens with extra needles and directions for use with a fingerstick log.  None  I have not used any patient starter kits.  Please see my earlier response in the provider section. I mentioned that over the years other companies have included a thermal carrier or travel pouch for their products and I suggested an option for this starter kit. 
Also, a favorite of mine was a slide-rule calculator for Protein/CHO/Fats servings based on daily caloric intake. It was in a gestational DM pamphlet and made it very easy for patients to know how many servings and what to include with each meal. Perhaps something similar with the protein calculator Ashlyn had mentioned.  mostly glucometers, insulin pens with videos etc, glucose logs.  I have just primarily used samples and pt ed materials, but no specific kits. I will just tailor it to what the pt needs (eg pump options, carb counting books, protein examples, etc)  I have never used any kits before  people who need to have meals on the go.  People who have motivation to try new things.  People who have some potential for malnutrition.  If they live with a supportive partner it would increase the chance they would try the kit.  Patients who are looking for meal replacements or low carb/high protein snack options.  BMI over 28
Obese
Diabetes
Pre diabetics
Eating disorders
Limited mobility
Patients that trust their healthcare provider
Healthcare Providers
People who work out daily  Patients who are busy and looking for ways to make their lives simpler. 
Patients who know they need to make healthy changes, but may not have the motivation or health literacy to understand how. 
Patients who have an unmet dietary protein intake for various reasons  Many of the patients I see are just like me, very busy!  We are working, trying to eat healthy and still maintain our busy schedules. Many are talking about a strong desire to lose weight or eat healthier a kit that focuses on these things and for specific populations like diabetics, those individuals with high cholesterol, or those looking to do the intermittent fasting which has been shown to have many benefits. The kit would be wonderful as it could help people launch a new healthier lifestyle that is easily accessible and cost effective.  Patients who are motivated to change, have hit barriers and are frustrated, patients who need more direction, patients who may not want to do a complete weight loss ""program"" but are looking for simple changes.  I like your point about where people live or who they live with. In addition to the great suggestions @all have mentioned below, we can also think about those whose living or working situations interfere with their attempts at lifestyle changes: those with children or partners who do not follow their same meal plan, thus the family is faced with making 2 versions of all meals; parents who are on the go either with young kiddos or teens with extracurriculars; professionals with a long commute or busy work day/working through lunch. These psychosocial factors leave people looking for quick, easy, prepared options to help them stay on track. @all Thank you so much for your responses to this questions. After thinking about all of your responses to the questions, are there any additional characteristics that might influence a patient to utilize a kit and benefit from what it provides? Perhaps thinking about people of all ages who may benefit from the kit.... would where they live or who they live with (for example), influence their use of the kit? People who are busy, motivated, patients wanting to better control their chronic diseases, post hospitalization, people who lose their hunger or living alone and not wanting to cook  @all Thank you so much for your responses to this questions.

I would listen to another's opinion but would like to try the kit and form my own opinion.  It just depends on what their opinion is and what they are basing it on.  If they have good reasons/proof then I might change my mind.  Yes, It will all depend on how knowledgeable I thought the healthcare professional is regarding the product.  A lot of my decisions are based on data and outcomes.  I agree with Maria Lena Walls, NP it depends on the person and their experience and like Ashlyn Smith, PA I love to hear other providers' ideas for use and tips for success.  I respect the opinions of my peers and I appreciate/value their input. I like to compare it to my own.  Another clinician's use or lack of use would not sway me directly, but I would love to hear tips of how clinicians are using them successfully.  Depends on the person and their experience  If you could give people a choice that would be optional.  I prefer electronic.  Paper is more concrete, something everyone is used to.  Electronic surveys are the best for me. Paper is too much to manage.  That depends on the patient population. I have elderly patients who would definitely want paper based, maybe a postage paid tri-fold they can complete, fold, seal and drop in the mail.  I prefer a short electronic survey because I can immediately return it.  See my answer to previous question :) Would recommend electronic for the vast majority of my patients.  Easier if electronic "
38,Experience & Educational Kits for PA/NPs and Patients,"I recommend products I have tried but also recommend products with an evidence based theory as an endorsement.  I've tried the mocha Glucerna and really like it so I mention that to patients when recommending Glucerna.  Yes! If I have tried and liked a product and knows it works well I definitely want to share it with others.  I tend to go into detail around the experience of the product and the value to me.  Yes, I recommend products I know, have tried or used when it would be of benefit to the patient. In addition, I do rely on evidence-based research to back the use of a product (or Med etc) and how it works when educating patients.  I think any evidence-based research that can be made available would enhance providers' understanding and recommendations for a product @all would information provided with the product be adequate for education or would you like to see or require additional studies or evidence along with the products prior to suggesting it to patients? Glucerna is something I provide samples of to my diabetics so they try it before investing in them. Many of my patients live on a fixed income so cost is an issue and being able to try first is crucial.  I also discuss how it can be a meal on the go substitute or they can just se half as a snack Answer: Yes.  Comment: Glucerna is something I provide samples of to my diabetics so they try it before investing in them. Many of my patients live on a fixed income so cost is an issue and being able to try first is crucial. In the realm of nutrition, I tend to recommend tips and tricks either I or someone I know have tried and would recommend. However, I have no problem recommending something I have not tried if there is good science behind it.  If a clinician is not familiar with the science behind the product, it would be good to include the studies that are currently available. Of course, this would not need to be included in the patient portion. 

Other areas that might be of interest for future studies: use in prediabetes and prevention of DM2, effect on GI symptoms/IBS. @all would information provided with the product be adequate for education or would you like to see or require additional studies or evidence along with the products prior to suggesting it to patients?

Thanks so much Holly :) I think any evidence-based research that can be made available would enhance providers' understanding and recommendations for a product That's great Diane Hart, MA, BA, ADN . It's great when we can recommend a product that tastes great. Answer: Yes.  Comment: I've tried the mocha Glucerna and really like it so I mention that to patients when recommending Glucerna. I think it is important for the NP/PA to understand what the product tastes like and understand the contents of the patient Kit so they can explain this educational material in depth with the patient.  I want to be able to speak from experience and if it doesn't taste good or work well, I would hesitate to recommend.  Absolutely! It is very important to try a product before recommending to patients.  I feel it adds more credibility to getting the patient's buy-in to trying it.  It would even help it I shop for the product and know more about cost and using the coupons.  Yes I would prefer small size just to see if I like it. @all when you try a product (as an HCP), would you prefer it in a smaller sample size (less waste if just sampling)? Or, would you prefer to try it in the standard size? I think it adds to the providers understanding of the product, its use, what they liked about it and recommendations for how they used it or how the patient can best utilize it.

Palate fatigue is an issue that often comes up when anyone (providers/patients) are following a dietary program.

I think patients would love something not creamy and more like juice if that is possible. In general, it would help a clinician ""buy into"" a product and be able to speak to satiety and taste if they have tried it. However, it is not essential because we recommend intervention that we have not tried all the time (medications, weight loss programs, etc).  Absolutely!

Or, would you prefer to try it in the standard size?  it also depends on the Provider.  My case managers have all tried the product and my Nurse Practitioners have also.  My physicians state they are ""too busy"".  I would, as I would like to be honest when recommending to patients.  I think it's great to try to get the providers involved by having them try, they would more likely recommend the product.  I would say Glucerna may go over better with healthcare providers ( the meal replacement) because we often miss meals while we are working, having a meal replacement on hand may be a huge benefit.  Abbott should bring some and put in the employee refrigerate/cabinet in the break room.  I think if you can fill a need for providers and patients, then providers would be receptive. I agree with Ashlyn Smith, PA that if the samples are sent to the office, they will most likely go to the patients. Having the rep there in person to specify the samples are for providers to use (and preferably on a day when lunch is not provided) would fill a need for busy providers - which would be a helpful testimonial when recommending it for patients who have the same need.  I think most would at least want to taste it prior to recommending it to patients.  If an office is shipped or given a box of samples, they would most like assume it is for patients only. If there were a meeting with clinicians (eg, a lunch program or a promotional meeting, I always recommend that samples are accessible for clinicians to try! 100% think that helps for clinicians to recommend the product.

184,Duopa Enrollment,"These numbers are fairly accurate, however we have seen steady improvement thanks to the hard work of Carolyn Taylor and Avram Fraint to get these patients through the pipeline.  Dayanna Ocegueda Thank you for this feedback.  We are really interested in learning more about this communication.  Can you expand more on your communication with the DuoConnect nurse case manager?  How often do you speak with her/him?  Do you setup specific time to talk with them?  Any advice on how you have adjusted to make this communication better? I think those numbers are pretty low. It can all be brought up with the proper training. I worked closely with the DuoConnect nurse case manager to make sure all the pivotal information needed was in the notes I was submitting. I have a check list with the criteria needed for approval. Prior to submitting any forms I go through the notes to make sure everything needed is documented if not Leonard Verhagen Jessica Karl will addend the notes as necessary. I think some providers must enroll patients at the patients request but do not really think they are good candidates.  I am surprised the number is so low. From my end, I always try to make sure that my note includes any information the insurance company may need to proceed with Duopa.  The time to procedure is about right.  I tend to book case about 4 weeks out.  
The 50% get the tube I think is a bit low.  Might be nice to know where they fall out.  I think this makes sense. Our center has prescribed Duopa so much that we have overcome the chart deficiencies but I recall early on that we would have to resubmit our enrollment forms/chart notes because of this. Dayanna (medical assistant/coordinator) has also helped with this process immensely. She makes sure prior to submission that everything is in place. Dayanna Ocegueda I am sure you have more to comment!  I do not think it requires extra work just specific wording. In DBS there is also specific information insurance companies look at to approve the therapy. @all Great insights into your process and workflow for submitting Duopa patient enrollment forms.  My question to all on the Neurologist side: Does Duopa require extra work for chart notes as compared to other advanced therapies after a prescription is submitted?

We are really interested in learning more about this communication.  Can you expand more on your communication with the DuoConnect nurse case manager?  How often do you speak with her/him?  Do you setup specific time to talk with them?  Any advice on how you have adjusted to make this communication better? Very likely correct, but this is something that can be rectified by having the 'Facilitator' advocate followup with the involved Movement Disorder/Parkinson's Clinic.  I think that 50% of patients never starting to open seems quite high based on our experience here at Vanderbilt.  Again, I never encounter those patients who might see one of our movement disorder neurologists and start the process, but then halt it before seeing me for their tube placement consult.  I would say that pretty much 100% of patients that actually get the tube at least start the therapy.  I would estimate that I have removed about 10% of the tubes that I have put in for various reasons, including patient dissatisfaction with either the tube itself or just lack of Duopa efficacy.  The average time to PEG-J procedure/% of patients who do not start Duopa is not surprising to me based on my own experiences.

Regarding completeness of chart notes, I would guess this is less common at academic centers where we (mostly) have adequate staffing and resources to help with the insurance approval process. My guess is you are more likely to see incomplete documentation in community based practices where there may not be as much support staff or familiarity with prescribing specialty medications. I would also guess that practices that have an NP/PA involved in the Duopa prescribing process are more likely to submit complete documentation.  That number is quite low. I don't know if the explanation of the procedure to patients and family affects the notes but the key is making sure there is good communication between proceduralist and MDS, making sure all detailed factors are written based on PD criteria for Duopa. Patients need to understand that the criteria for Duopa are affecting their QOL and we need to send patients to the proceduralists only when the patient is comfortable moving forward.  @all Great insights into your process and workflow for submitting Duopa patient enrollment forms.  My question to all on the Neurologist side: Does Duopa require extra work for chart notes as compared to other advanced therapies after a prescription is submitted?  The 33% would be something you can work on. Perhaps you can provide especially new centers with a 'script' they can convert into a EMR smartphrase forcing them to touch upon all necessary points in their documentation.  This is true. Dayanna Ocegueda keeps me in line and makes sure the notes are complete! I think those numbers are pretty low. It can all be brought up with the proper training.

Prior to submitting any forms I go through the notes to make sure everything needed is documented if not Leonard Verhagen Jessica Karl will addend the notes as necessary. agree with Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C . It is perhaps an idea to provide newer sites with examples of the exact wording needed to get approval so that newer sites don't get delayed or rejected. Sites could make that into smart phrases so the documentation is even easier. You can include in such examples also a smart phrase that would help remind sites to check labs from time to time. @all Great insights into your process and workflow for submitting Duopa patient enrollment forms.  My question to all on the Neurologist side: Does Duopa require extra work for chart notes as compared to other advanced therapies after a prescription is submitted? I'd agree with 30-40% of patients not enrolling. The primary concerns being the fear about managing the tube itself or the tube becoming dislodged or clogged. We have established a process where our patients here at NMH can reach out to us 24/7 with tube related issues and can get an appointment in clinic within 24-48 hours to help troubleshoot the tube or arrange tube replacement endoscopically within a week as an outpatient as long as there is not another reason for admission.  I can personally attest to the degree of attention that Carolyn Taylor and Avram Fraint contribute to this patient population, and have seen more patients signing up for these tubes now with their care protocol and attention to detail as well. Absolutely we recommend all patients considering Duopa speak with a current Duopa patient, and sometimes even recommend the care partner speak to another care partner. Fear of the tube getting dislodged due to loved ones becoming confused at night and pulling out the tube or getting caught on as doors, etc. Also agree with the dexterity being an issue they are concerned with in order to work the pump or troubleshoot it when it alarms. The patient support program has been helpful with mitigating these fears and also we try our best to take the ""guess work"" out of troubleshooting the tube at home and have the families call or page afterhours to  help with tube related issues. The added support gives them piece of mind, but there are still some that have those remaining fears. Is there one or two reasons that come to mind for why patients don't start therapy?  Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis I think about 20% of ours never start treatment.  They are all taking L-DOPA and have a good response so it is not the drug,   If they decide against it is is because they don't want to deal with the pump / tube. Is there one or two reasons that come to mind for why patients don't start therapy?  Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis Given that Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC thinks that nearly half of our patients enrolled never start treatment, I suspect this is also the case at other centers.  We also I only recommend it with certain patients who are hesitant or have questions about living with the tube itself. Douglas Varian we have certain patients with the Duopa reach out to patients who are interested in speaking with someone who has already undergone the procedure. We tend to not utilize the mentor line. 30-40%  1) Permanent tubing/patient fear, 2) lack of a care partner Is there one or two reasons that come to mind for why patients don't start therapy?  Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis Maybe about half of patient. We have a lot of patients who sign the consent, but never follow through.  Douglas Varian we have certain patients with the Duopa reach out to patients who are interested in speaking with someone who has already undergone the procedure. We tend to not utilize the mentor line. Great insights Leonard Verhagen Do you suggest to all potential Duopa patients to talk with other Duopa patients via the Duopa mentor line or only certain patients/caregivers that may be hesitant?  I would be curious if others reinforce speaking with other Duopa patients as well, and what their process is in facilitating this conversation @all ~20%. I agree that the reason is lack of adequate family support, and also going through a procedure.  I think lack of family and close support systems is one of the big reasons why patients don't get to this treatment. I also think that when DBS teams are aggressive in marketing and doing procedures, you will see a shift towards the DBS spectrum.  I think there could be some marketing strategies that could be deployed by Abbvie as a corporate entity to help patients and their families understand duopa.  Not sure, since I never see patietns who change their mind about enrolling after they see Tom Davis (or one of our other neurologists) but before seeing me or my NPs.  I would guess similar to my own experience, 40-50%?  The #1 reason in my experience is lack of social/familial support. Secondarily many patients don't proceed due to fears about having a procedure.

We all will have had experience with going through the process of educating the patient, providing literature, information, filling out forms, and communicating with colleagues, only to find out that the patient in the end decides not to go through with it. As a result we have become more insightful into whether a patient is serious about wanting this therapy or not. 
Centers with less experience do not have that same learning experience and may be guided by their enthusiasm and start the process even if patients are not 100% on board. 100% agree with Jessica Karl and others who mention lack of care partners as a main problem. And sometimes IF patient have a care partner, it is that care partner who does not feel he/she can deal with the technology, who will pull the plug. Hearing form other patients is often very helpful for patients who are in doubt. Probably 40%.

Hearing form other patients is often very helpful for patients who are in doubt.  Roughly 30-60 days based on patient's willingness and scheduling for the procedure/admission. Oour patient's are hospitalized overnight after the procedure for monitoring which also adds to the patient coordination as well. This has also been challenging during COVID given fear of hospitalization/exposure vs hospital bed availability for ""elective"" procedures.  I would estimate 2-3 months.  Still,  much quicker than DBS. I would estimate 2-3 months. I would guess that it varies similarly to what we see at Northwestern - anywhere from 30 days to 6 months.  I would say at centers that regularly prescribe Duopa 1-3 months. At centers that do not regularly prescribe much longer, 3-6 months.  From the time we get ""cleared to ship""? It can take about 4-6 weeks, but that depends on the GI's availability.  To clarify, when you say 'Clearance of a Duopa Script' does that mean that the preauthorization process is complete in writing? 
If that is the case, if yes , then around  ~ 4 weeks.  Really not sure on this one.  Assuming other practices face the same challenges with patient readiness that I do, I would guess at least several months.  Brad Durbin Douglas Varian Kendall Cook Eric Lynch  Can you Clarify ""Looking at data across the US.."" Is there some data I'm missing you have to share or other information for us to analyze? 

I agree with Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C that there is a bias between centers with regularity of doing Duopa procedures vs those not as frequent. I think 30-45 days is what we see in our region.  Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. Good question, you are not missing any data.  The question implies if you are looking at the data across the country, what would be your estimate for this time frame.  Has your time frame stayed fairly steady over the years or increased/decreased? Brad Durbin Douglas Varian Kendall Cook Eric Lynch  Can you Clarify ""Looking at data across the US.."" Is there some data I'm missing you have to share or other information for us to analyze? 

I agree with Jessica Karl that there is a bias between centers with regularity of doing Duopa procedures vs those not as frequent. I think 30-45 days is what we see in our region. I guess the point of the question is for us to guess what the average time is WITHOUT looking at the dat?
In that case I agree with Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C and oether that the average will be a bit longer for non-experienced centers, up to 6 months.  Typically 30-40% due to fear from managing the tube itself or the pump technology  I would estimate 10-20%,  Hello all.  Thank you for your comments on this topic.  Is there anything that you think could or would improve this percentage?  I would defer to Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC on this, but I am surprised to see her estimate of about 40%. I would have guessed this to be lower.  Probably around 20% of patients.  Less than 20%, but those are the patient's that are typically very anxious.  I think around 20%.  Consistently prevails !  I'll have to defer to Tom Davis on this one.  I'm pretty sure that practically ALL the patients that see us in Gen Surg clinic eventually go on to get there PEG-J tube placed.  The only one I can think of who didn't was a recent patient who had previously had a Gastric Bypass, and would have this required a modified (laparoscopic) placement of her tube.  Since this would represent a significantly more invasive procedure, I had her go through a Duopa trial with the nasojejunal tube first.  The patient felt that she didn't get much benefit from the medication, so she decided not to proceed with permanent tube placement.  I can't think of any other patients that I've seen who have not ultimately gotten the PEG-J placed.  Probably about 40%  10-15 %. We have asked patients to only move forward and enroll once they are confident in the idea of the PEG-J tube and Duopa therapy which I think keeps this % typically lower. Our surgeon does a great job of instilling confidence in patients based on outcomes from prior cases. I wish patients would be able to only enroll and start the auth process only after they see both the surgeon and neurologist. Having the neurologist enroll them first before seeing the proceduralist will affect this number.  I think less than 20% is a reasonable estimate.
With Covid it may have been higher than usual, as patients like to stay away form the hospital.
To answer Brad Durbin ways to bring that down could be as Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. suggested, and prescribe only after Neuro and GI have both seen and reassured the patient. I usually don't do that because by the time they come and see me for interventional therapies they want something done and I don't want to delay the process. But it may be a good practice when one discovers trepidation on the patien's side.  30-60  I would say it is usually in the 30 day range.  I believe they are often evaluated by surgery prior to med approval.  Our surgeon would know better. None of our patients have ever complained about the wait.  The average time it takes between the initial consultation with me until the PEG-J is placed is (at best) usually 30-60 days. This seems to vary considerably based on insurance and also how aggressive the patient is about proceeding.  I would agree with Leo, it is likely 1-2 months from signing the script to the PEG-J procedure. The usual delay is the patient having second thoughts.  Douglas Varian I do think it has sped up, likely because we are familiar (with the help of Dayanna Ocegueda) with what insurance companies require so we write what is required in our notes initially. In the past we would often times have to update our notes and resubmit which would prolong the process. Hi Jessica &amp; others - Has the time frame of clearance sped up over the years of prescribing Duopa?  If so, any particular reason you think? It depends. Sometimes it can be as quick as 6 weeks depending on the availability of the GI doctors and how quick we can get through the insurance verification process. Or it can take up to 2 months or more if we are having difficulty with  patient's having second thoughts or with facilities approving the drug for patients.  4 to 6 weeks. This includes getting a Interventional Radiology Clinic consultation and then setting up the procedure with anesthesia in the IR lab. There is potential if clinically necessary to ' truncate' this time.  It appears that the time frame is pretty consistent in most of the practices. ~ 4-8 weeks. Good to know that we are in the middle.  Thanks Tom Davis, that probably sounds about right.  We usually try to get the patients in an seen by one of our Clinic NPs as soon as we are made aware of the patient's Duopa eligibility and/or decision to proceed with the medication.  That way we can get them scheduled for the OR as quickly as possible.  There can often be a 2-4 week time frame from their clinic visit to their procedure in the OR, depending on my operative availability. I would say it is usually in the 30 day range.  I believe they are often evaluated by surgery prior to med approval.  Our surgeon would know better. None of our patients have ever complained about the wait. If the patient is ready to proceed with the PEG-J procedure, then typically 30-45 days. Pt readiness to proceed with Duopa often leads to delays in scheduling the GI consult and/or the PEG-J procedure, and in this case I have had some patients wait 6 months to a year before proceeding with Duopa (after already being cleared to ship)  14 days to indefinite....I agree with all of you on this question. A few patients have been quite motivated and get into our amazing surgeon's Caitlin Houghton, MD office, and are ready to go with a scheduled procedure date just over 2 weeks.  We have patients only sign for clearance of the Duopa script only if there is a reasonable timeline and motivation to have it done, and that has allowed most of our patients to have the procedure done in a month. However, there is a range from 30 days to 60 days based on insurance authorizing the procedure and second thoughts about the procedure from patients that delay this timetable. We have however many patients that were so motivated and decided to hold off for a time period, and have come back to it a year later.  Hi Jessica &amp; others - Has the time frame of clearance sped up over the years of prescribing Duopa?  If so, any particular reason you think? I would agree with Leo, it is likely 1-2 months from signing the script to the PEG-J procedure. The usual delay is the patient having second thoughts. Not sure what 'clearance of a Duopa script means', but assume it is when we sent out the script; from there until PEG-J it is probably 2 months. That is IF I did not forget to write in the chart what different medications have been tried in the past, or other details. "
201,Final Feedback on the Platform/Engagement,"The instructions were simple and clear.  I think that the kick-off was important to A. understand the expectation and use of the platform and B. adds a personal touch to put some faces to the names in the group.  It was helpful to walk through the functionalities of the platform.  The slides presented in the virtual meeting represented exactly what would be discussed and how to navigate the page.  I appreciated the transparency of how the system operates and also the expectations being set on how to utilize the platform in a way that would be helpful for us as providers and giving appropriate feedback and insight through the threads.  I thought the 1-hour kickoff was sufficient in providing background for the platform and what was expected of the participants. It was also nice to see everyone virtually!  Very helpful to get oriented.  He has but it is still much harder to discuss in this format versus in person or virtually real-time.  Should have been, yes the website was helpful but I am a terrible typist and it is much easier to discuss, real-time. Answer: Yes.  Comment: He has but it is still much harder to discuss in this format versus in person or virtually real-time. I think this platform is a great alternative to in-person meetings during the pandemic. It is easy to use and understand.  Overall I think the platform works.  I liked that I could fit it in when my schedule allowed.  

I think that there should be a free forum for physicians to start a discussion on a specific issue or ask a specific question related to process that others on the board could help with.  I think the platform was very easy to use and it was convenient to be able to log on whenever rather than having to set aside a full or half day to participate in the advisory board. However, when I logged on I tended to chug through the questions, and since I was one of the first to answer many of the questions, I definitely missed the dialogue aspect of an in person advisory board.

Also, the email notifications were excessive, I would get about 10 per day :)  Super easy to use. The questions were straight forward. It was very simple to reply to others or to ""tag"" them in your comments. It was not at all time consuming.  Very helpful and also very insightful. I have learned a great deal from my colleagues and as always from our partners at AbbVie. More importantly I was able to incorporate logging into this platform without having to clear or adjust my schedule to make it for an in-person experience. I also feel that the conversations that are sometimes cut short due to time constraints were able to happen more fluidly without potential interruptions.  I enjoyed using this platform. I felt navigating the platform was easy and intuitive. I also thought it was nice that everyone had a chance to give their opinion.  Like  Dr Thakkar , I also believe that there are younger patients who would benefit from this therapy compared to DBS.  Good, but access was a challenge after password reset did not work for 2 days  The website is easy to use.  Some of the questions seemed redundant.  I think you did a good job of introducing the platform.  It was user friendly and easy to navigate  I thought the 1-hour kick off was adequate.  It was very simple to utilize.  I felt the tutorial was more than sufficient. The alerts on the homepage also allow you to pick right back up where you left off in the conversation which is also helpful.    One of the challenges with busy physicians is ability to stay signed on for a longer period of time at a stretch. 
I faced a terrible problem getting back in because of a technical glitch that took 2 days to resolve. I was surprised that when a password reset is requested , the email link and directions would not show up in your inbox for a very long time , such that I had to make phone calls, talk to multiple people, attempts made by multiple people and finally a resolution to the problem literally ~ 5 hours before closure on a regular working day. Within 3 needs to do a better job at this.  The platform was easy to use.  Without hesitation  I think that this type of advisory board was easy to participate in.  Nice that there was freedom to work around busy schedules.  I would be happy to participate in advisory board like this again, because it was very easy for me to do. I am more of an active listener than participator in group settings, so I think an online forum provides a better platform for me personally to express my ideas. As I mentioned earlier, I did miss the dialogue aspect of an in person adboard but obviously each environment has its pros and cons.  It was very interesting to see the different types of experiences others have had with the Duopa process. Our office has a very smooth process when it comes to enrolling new patients and if we can help other offices get to this point that would be great.  Of course!  Definitely!  If there is better technical support. Within 3 should take responsibility for their technical limitations in a simple thing like password reset. Shocking!  But I greatly prefer a real-time discussion either in person or over Zoom etc. "
210,Best Practices for Successful Duopa Treatment Teams,"I'm sure this is already being done, but if each patient  is mandatorily assigned a Nurse Educator, that would be tremendous. I have seen patients that felt ""over-confident"" in their abilities since they have had tubes before and then ultimately fail to seek help until there are large issues because they tried to inappropriately manipulate the connectors. Not sure if that will entirely fix the issue, but at least would provide more of an ""opt out"" scenario as opposed to ""opt-in"" for support.  Maybe providing semi-annual to annual updates regarding the medication or company changes along with any patient specific handouts they would like us to distribute to patients during those points of contact in clinic or after their procedures. @all How can your local Account executive / representative be more helpful? I do not have any further suggestions.  None  pretty satisfied as well.  But update on changes from the company side would be helpful like Harold Boutte, Jr, MD mentioned @all How can your local Account executive / representative be more helpful? I am very happy!  No suggestions.  I believe podcasts targeted to potential Parkinson's patients AFTER their physicians have initiated the conversation regarding Duopa Gel Treatment with a dedicated GJ tube may help facilitate better understanding. Also providing periodic updates would be worthwhile. Having coordinated zoom conferences on line may also be a consideration, basically a platform for patients and families to ask questions to a panel.  I think this is a regulatory thing, but it would be helpful if nurse ambassadors could communicate with the patient's treatment team directly. Currently I think the nurse ambassador has to speak with Duoconnect, who then has to relay the issue to me (correct me if I'm wrong). I feel like this makes communication feel less familiar and more disjointed. I imagine patients would be more satisfied if there could be more open lines of communication.  I do think having younger patients with Duopa need to be involved with any marketing such as their success stories. Abbvie needs to show that dyskinesias can be better controlled with Duopa. There has been post marketing data about this.  @all How can your local Account executive / representative be more helpful?  Satisfied  I think our account executive is helpful and responsive @all How can your local Account executive / representative be more helpful? This is an interesting point. In general younger patients tend to be 'automatically' directed towards DBS and the question is if that in the end is always the best strategy. For instance, young patients who are fluctuators, but don't have significant dyskinesias or LD resistant tremor, and who are on not on very high daily doses of LD could be good candidates for infusion therapies as well. So showing that possibility may change the image of Duopa as a therapy for only those who are no good candidates for DBS. I do think having younger patients with Duopa need to be involved with any marketing such as their success stories. Abbvie needs to show that dyskinesias can be better controlled with Duopa. There has been post marketing data about this. interacting through both email and EPIC when issues are occurring. Carolyn Taylor is incredibly responsive!  The neurologists and NP see each other frequently in clinic.  We communicate with the surgical team through the electronic medical record.  Patients are often referred to my by other movement disorders neurologists in our practice. After I evaluate them I then forward their name to Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC via EPIC and she then takes care of insurance approval, consultation with the proceduralist, and titration visit. She and I are in touch frequently during the initial phases of Duopa initiation.  Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. Once a patient is referred to my clinic for Tube placement and deemed a good candidate, our nurses really do all the work behind the scenes to get them scheduled. They talk on email, test or phone.  About once a year we all try to go out to dinner together to have a more in depth conversation about how things are going and discuss any improvements that need to be made,  Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD or myself will see a patient that is either in our practice already or referred by another movement disorder neurologist in our group. We will then involve Dayanna Ocegueda who will start the process of submitting for insurance approval.  We interact through epic or verbally. The occur intermittently, not at regular times. Leonard Verhagen or myself will see a patient that is either in our practice already or referred by another movement disorder neurologist in our group. We will then involve Dayanna Ocegueda who will start the process of submitting for insurance approval. We usually interact through Epic. Prior to the PEG J procedure we are notified.  The interaction between the IR team, Our Clinic Team and the Movement disorder Nursing team and support team is excellent. our goal is simple: to provide efficient care that is patient focused in an expeditious fashion. This has worked so far. 
The Movement disorder team really likes my Clinic Facilitator.  Unless Tom Davis is holding out on me, we have not had any group meetings since the program started.  I agree with him that we largely communicate via the electronic medical record, and again, most of that initial contact is done amongst the nurse practitioners in neurology, surgery, and interventional radiology.  Every now and then, if there is an extenuating circumstance, I will either call my interventional radiologist or Tom Davis directly to discuss a particular patient.  Our team interacts through email/Epic. We generally have several touchpoints throughout the Duopa process 1) when a patient is referred, 2) when the Duopa script is approved and pt is ready to schedule the GI consult, 3) when the PEG-J procedure/Duopa titration is scheduled, 4) after the titration  my answer is consistent with Caitlin Houghton, MD. We do not meet that often as our staff does the majority of communication. I think once or twice a year is sufficient but if there are issues with patient selection, changes in procedure methods or tubing, then meeting even more frequent is appropriate.  The critical team members in neurology are in daily contact about all clinical issues. Once a patient of mine shows solid interest in Duopa, I give them detailed information, hand out brochures, connect them with a patient if they like and ask them to think about it and call me back after discussing it with their support at home, once they are sure they want to move forward. I already have them sign the form, which is kept by Dayanna Ocegueda our 'Mobilizer', until the patient gets back to us, so we don't have to collect a signature at a later time. Since Dayanna Ocegueda sees all my phone calls and MyCharts she is mde aware of the patient's decision before I do and moves the process forward. Communications between neurology and GI occur through Epic. On the day of titration in clinic, the GI PA is kind enough to stop by in clinic to check on the stoma.  Also did not know this existed but would be very useful.  I think the resource is a helpful one in the sense that it provides very general information regarding the tube without going into detail about how the tube is placed or who is placing it so as to avoid confusion if it is GI vs Surgery vs IR who is placing the tube and their protocols. If this is meant to be the ""Tube Guide"" then post-tube care and standard language for that which was included on the Placement also need to be provided here as well as the flow sheet for how it works for the patient to see Neurology, get approved, get tube placed, post-tube care, and then resources such as DuoConnect and titration.

This pamphlet has more risks of the procedure and potential complications than actual information on his the tube or pump functions and the steps needed to get there. Harold Boutte, Jr Richard A Pierce Sanjiv Parikh if you are familiar with this piece, how have you used it and is it beneficial?  Do you have any changes that would make this more useful to you and your team? I think it is best if the proceduralist manages the tube and the neurologist manages the medicine.  Neurologist should determine if the patient is a candidate for Duopa and Proceduralist should determine if the patient is a candidate for the tube.  Patient needs to be a candidate for both.  Proceduralist does not need to be discussing expectations of Duopa with the patient only potential complications of the tube and how they might be handled.  Harold Boutte, Jr, MD Richard A Pierce, MD, PhD Sanjiv Parikh, MD, DRM if you are familiar with this piece, how have you used it and is it beneficial?  Do you have any changes that would make this more useful to you and your team?  I have not seen this resource.  I think this is something that is beneficial for the patients especially showing the carrying cases.  I get asked that a lot.  I may give it to the patient but not sure it would be instrumental in my discussion.  I have not seen this resource.  I did not know this existed.  This is terrific, we would love to see all our patients get access to this before we do our consultation.  I was not aware of this resource - curious if our GI team finds it helpful.  Very nice brochure. It can assist as part of the discussion with the GI doc, provide confidence in the procedure, and reinforce what was already discussed by the MDS  Agree with Tom Davis that by the time the patient comes to the proceduralist they should not require any more convincing that Duopa works and why. 
From an information point of view, the brochure does not seem focused. There is a bit of information on why the therapy is good (but not enough to convince anyone) and there is a bit of information on the procedure, but not enough to be very helpful in telling the patient what to expect.  Didn't even know this was available but will request copies as this has language regarding tube care which I would like to review with patients upon discharge after placement.  Tom Davis thank you.  Your comments are well received and we can definitely see how the placemat could seem overly complicated.  Do you think a annual/semi-annual meeting with your treatment team members at Vanderbilt dedicated to discussing responsibilities and evolving management topics would be helpful?  Is it something you already do?  Would something like this be helpful for AbbVie to host? We would probably not use it.  It seems over complicated.  Our patients continue to see the doctor they have always seen and contact surgery if they have problems with the tube.  I think the simpler you can make it seem to the patient, the more they view it as ""no big deal"" and are more likely to try the therapy. Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C Thank you and we agree this resource is more geared towards treatment teams just getting started.  Does your established treatment team at Rush regularly meet to discuss and refine responsibilities and evolving patient management topics? We have not participated in a program using this resource. I think this resource would be useful for a team new to Duopa. We would probably not use it.  It seems over complicated.  Our patients continue to see the doctor they have always seen and contact surgery if they have problems with the tube.  I think the simpler you can make it seem to the patient, the more they view it as ""no big deal"" and are more likely to try the therapy.  Seems like something we could try to incorporate in the future. Our neuro and GI teams had a meeting several years ago, prior to the development of this placemat resource. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to get together with our new treatment team (including new neurologist and proceduralist) due in part to the pandemic. I agree that this may be nice for new partnerships so that not only the physicians know the roles but that the supportive staff know the workflow as well.  Our team happened organically but this a nice resource to have to start conversation about roles and workflow.  We have not participated in a program using this resource. I think this resource would be useful for a team new to Duopa.  At our center we do not regularly meet but we will discuss if an issue arises to prevent it in the future. Jessica Karl Thank you and we agree this resource is more geared towards treatment teams just getting started.  Does your established treatment team at Rush regularly meet to discuss and refine responsibilities and evolving patient management topics? I've never used this placemat, but perhaps it could be useful.  Have not used this resource personally but I believe the Movement Disorder point person does use some segment of this  plan. 
I did notice that everywhere the tube is described at percutaneous endoscopic PEG-J. Being an interventional radiologist performing this procedure, it would be worthwhile also including 'IR Percutaneous pull through Gastro-J'.  I was not aware that this was available, and I have never used it.  It does seem like it would be a helpful resource though!  Our neuro and GI teams had a meeting several years ago, prior to the development of this placemat resource. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to get together with our new treatment team (including new neurologist and proceduralist) due in part to the pandemic.  I think we can utilize this format but I think it can be more useful for programs starting up. It doesn't fit our need as an established program  Have not used the placement, but it may be a good starting point for a meeting between all players of a new Duopa team.
I think it is useful to have a team meeting with the different disciplines. We had one or 2 such dinner meetings and there are always issues to discuss. Importantly it also is an opportunity to show appreciation to all involved and renew the engagement of all parties to the therapy.  Completely agree with Avram. Carolyn works tirelessly with this patient population and does an excellent job communicating with their families and helping to get follow-up arranged seamlessly. We try and support as much as we can from a GI perspective with getting patients in for an evaluation and troubleshooting tube issues when they arise in quick manor to match the level of care that Carolyn and Avram provide. Thankfully Carolyn Taylor has lots of experience in this area and is the main reason (from the neurology side) our Duopa program runs so smoothly. Lack of experience with these tubes (or tubes in general) and also the lack of bandwidth to help accommodate these patients when issues arise. Thankfully AbbVie and the nurse educators have been incredibly supportive and have been present at my clinic visits and during tube placement/exchanges to help ensure optimal troubleshooting and functioning of the tube itself. It gives me piece of mind that I have solid support backing my clinical practice, but also instills in me a sense of personal confidence when placing and troubleshooting this technology. I have been more inclined to refer other colleagues to start placing these tubes as well because of this and have started to partner with some of our surgery colleagues (Dr. Ezra Teitelbaum) and our Radiology Colleagues (Heather Molina PA-C) as well who also help with these tube placements. @all When you speak with colleagues/peers who are not involved in Duopa Treatment Teams, what have you heard about why they have not formed or joined a team? Communication from the Neurology to Procedural side is key, but thankfully we have a great and efficient team!  Good surgical support is the key.  With it, Duopa is no more complicated than any other therapy.  Hi Carolyn.  This question is to Carolyn and others, does your Duopa team function any differently from other groups within your practice?  If so, how? I would say reasons for our success are 1) good communication between team members and 2) clear understanding of everyone's role in the Duopa start process. @all When you speak with colleagues/peers who are not involved in Duopa Treatment Teams, what have you heard about why they have not formed or joined a team?  Thankfully Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC has lots of experience in this area and is the main reason (from the neurology side) our Duopa program runs so smoothly.  From a surgical perspective providers may be concerned that their clinic may turn in to a tube management depot which is not the most rewarding.  However, In my experience, I find tube complications are fairly uncommon and those that do occur often the nurses can trouble shoot.  Also, I have EGD block time which is uncommon for most surgeons. This makes dealing with replacements and new implantation easier. @all When you speak with colleagues/peers who are not involved in Duopa Treatment Teams, what have you heard about why they have not formed or joined a team? Dayanna Ocegueda contributes most to the success from a neurology standpoint. We also have an excellent GI team who are extremely responsive. Often times tubes are replaced without neurology ever knowing there was an issue.  The communication between our neurology department, GI and DuoConnect contributes most to the success. Our nurse case manager is very good at communicating what is needed to speed up the process or when the patient is ready for the next step.  Transparency in Commuication, keep a 'llistening ear' for helping patients and keeping execution of logistics clear. 
This is a team approach game we play. so far it is working. I believe the critical piece is a willing service in IR wanting to partner with Movement disorder team in helping these patients.  Although all 3 disciplines (neurology, surgery, interventional radiology) work hand-in-hand, I like the fact that we have kept our duties quite compartmentalized.  My nurse practitioners and I are more than happy to deal with any and all problems that deal with the tube itself.  We are comfortable either fixing/replacing them ourselves, or directing them to interventional radiology as needed.  If a patient has a question about the medication itself, we immediately refer them to our excellent team of neurologists who (thankfully!) deal with all the medication adjustments and counseling.  I would say reasons for our success are 1) good communication between team members and 2) clear understanding of everyone's role in the Duopa start process.  The team that is most comparable to the Duopa team is the DBS team. There are many similarities in the workflow. The major difference is that there are more hurdles (neuropsych testing, sinemet study) for patients to be considered a candidate for DBS, so our DBS team meets monthly to review those cases. Otherwise we function and communicate similarly for Duopa and DBS referrals. Hi Carolyn.  This question is to Carolyn and others, does your Duopa team function any differently from other groups within your practice?  If so, how? I think we have our defined roles, and we are keeping to the particular criteria for patient candidacy. From the neurology perspective we are trying to only send qualified patients with advanced PD to the GI specialist for consultation. We do not want to refer patients unnecessarily to GI  Initially the Nurse Educator (Tony D) was an important reason we got the program running with him being the communicator between all different parties. Once we had all players identified Dayanna Ocegueda has taken over that role of 'mobilizer' and has the entire team on her speed dial. So communication remains the most important part of the process and reason for a smooth workflow. Our GI collaborator and his PAs has been tremendous. If patients are concerned about their stoma they send pictures to GI directly and get immediate responses.  My colleagues within our Movement Disorder group usually refer to Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C and me because we also evaluate patients for other therapies such as DBS. That way patients get whatever is the most appropriate therapy. 
I am not sure why other Movement Disorder groups would not form 'teams'. Perhaps because they are more interested in DBS for fluctuators? @all When you speak with colleagues/peers who are not involved in Duopa Treatment Teams, what have you heard about why they have not formed or joined a team? Didn't know this was available either and would be better if these different resources were compiled into one Tube specific resource that is distributed by the Proceduralist  Didn't know this resource was available. Would prefer to use Abbvie Standard language as we have been using our own standard handouts for tube care in general in my practice. Would be helpful so this can be re-enforced across both GI and Neurology clinics as points of patient contact. Caitlin Houghton Harold Boutte, Jr do you use this resource to provide your patients with post procedure information or is there another specific resource you prefer? Caitlin Houghton, MD Harold Boutte, Jr, MD do you use this resource to provide your patients with post procedure information or is there another specific resource you prefer?  You would need to ask our surgeon.  we have not used the resource at NW  I do use this post procedure information.  It is given to them in a packet of information. The part that I do not like and tell them to ignore is the moving the tube portion.  I do not want them to move the tube.  I feel it puts them at more risk for the stomach to fall away from the abdominal wall.  I do make sure they know what to do if the tube is sliding in and out and not secured tightly to the skin. Then I tell them to unclasp, pull out til there is resistance, then secure the clasp close to the skin.  I have a problem with the move the tube daily information seen throughout these informational packets.  I get the ideal is preventing the bumper from imbedding into the tissue but I think the risk of the stomach falling away from the abdominal wall is much more concerning and I don't think patients need to worry about moving the tube.  I would prefer that the information discuss that the tube should not slide and the clasp should be close to the skin.  If they see the tube sliding then give instructions on how to unclamp and pull until resistance...  I have not seen this resource. This would be a good resource for neurology RNs/MAs to have for when patients call our office regarding their tubing.  I am not sure if patients receive this after procedure, but it would be a good guide for them to follow.  All our patients get this information.  After the procedure is completed.  I haven't seen this resource before, but I know NM's GI team has a similar, internal document they developed for Duopa patients.  This is fantastic and did not know like others that this existed. These resources need to be given either by the home nurse or after the procedure. For neurology, its good for us to have this as well incase discussions arise  Richard A Pierce, MD, PhD is this a piece that is used for your patients for post procedure information, or is there something specific to your institution that is typically used? You would need to ask our surgeon. Not sure if our GI team uses this or have their own handouts  The Neuro Team has been great about providing these resources. Personally I would like to request these handouts for my clinical practice so I can review the Tube Care instructions with the patient as we have been giving them our own standard language for tube care, but would be helpful to provide a clear and unified message with the Abbvie materials they are given.  Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD thank you for this suggestion!  Please expand a little bit more on your this idea.  Are you thinking of something simple (a 1-pager or small card) you could hand out to patients?  Or something simple that you have for your team to reference at the office? Answer: Yes.  Comment: It would be good to have this slide in the office with the appropriate telephone numbers and websites Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD very helpful.  thank you! I was more thinking about a quick reference for office staff. As more people are getting involved with our expanding program, it would be good for everyone to have immediate access to the right person. @all please see Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD comments in this section in reference to a resource guide he would like for his staff (with much of the info shared on the attached slide) as they expand.  Would anyone else find something like this useful and does anyone else have any additional commentary?  We are aware.  Vaguely.  I do know about the nursing teams and patient support but don't know the details of how they work and how the patient's are contacted/made aware of these resources.  I agree this would be nice.  A brief description of the information available with that resource and the contact info/ website link would be helpful. 

I kind of like the idea of a patient directed card as well if these are resources they can initiate on their own. I was more thinking about a quick reference for office staff. As more people are getting involved with our expanding program, it would be good for everyone to have immediate access to the right person. I find these resources extremely useful.  I utilize some of the resources.  But not have used this routinely, however, the script is followed by the coordinating nurse.  Yes, I am aware of these resources and use them frequently.  I agree that would be a helpful resource, particularly for office staff who help make referrals for Duopa but may not be directly involved in the process.
Something similar for patients would also be useful (I think there may be some iteration of a resource Guide in their daily duopa book once they've already have the procedure done) @all please see Leonard Verhagen comments in this section in reference to a resource guide he would like for his staff (with much of the info shared on the attached slide) as they expand.  Would anyone else find something like this useful and does anyone else have any additional commentary? We have been aware of these resources. I think its good to have as training for those new to the group or a center that is beginning a Duopa program  It would be good to have this slide in the office with the appropriate telephone numbers and websites  I was more thinking about a quick reference for office staff. As more people are getting involved with our expanding program, it would be good for everyone to have immediate access to the right person. Leonard Verhagen thank you for this suggestion!  Please expand a little bit more on your this idea.  Are you thinking of something simple (a 1-pager or small card) you could hand out to patients?  Or something simple that you have for your team to reference at the office? From the Duopa Workflow perspective, this is right on point. I have learned more about the optional patient support mechanisms through this Ad Board and know that the majority of these connections are made through Neurology, but this will certainly enhance my practice as well with re-iterating their availability and importance. The Nurse Educator role is vitally important.  Other than COVID related restrictions; in general I personally could do a better job of setting up team meetings between Neuro and GI so we can assess how to improve our efficiency with referral to procedure time @all Have you personally noticed improvements in the process and timing recently?  Secondly, any specific recommendations you might suggest to improve the experience? Since all  our providers use Duopa, we have at least one less step.  We do not refer them to the ""Duopa person"".  This is an accurate reflection of what I see with my patients.  Agree it is accurate  This accurately represents the patient experience at Rush University.  I haven't noticed any change but do not have any issues either! @all Have you personally noticed improvements in the process and timing recently?  Secondly, any specific recommendations you might suggest to improve the experience? This is an accurate description of the patient experience.  Overall , our patieints have loved the 'process' of getting their Duopa Gel Therapy initiated including the interventional procedure . Despite multiple  points of contact and communication, it is really amazing to see all the pieces of the puzzle come together for these patients ! That means everybody's heart is in the right place to help patients!  I think that overall, it is a very nice and smooth process.  The patients really appreciate the nurse ambassadors who come out to their homes to assist them with the tubes and troubleshoot any problems.  I think the patients also benefit from the fact that my nurse practitioners are in clinic 5 days a week so they can assist with tube problems even if I am not there.  I know that the neurology nurse practitioner is also available to assist patients 5 days a week.  I think this accurately describes the experience of our patients at NM.  It seems consistent with what we do at Hoag. I cannot imagine anything different outside of having part of the On-boarding to be a phone call immediately with the Nurse Ambassador. Having such early communication can be re-assuring.  @all Have you personally noticed improvements in the process and timing recently?  Secondly, any specific recommendations you might suggest to improve the experience?  Yes, this seems like a good representation.
I would like for the Duopa nurse ambassador to perhaps make another visit after 1 month, to make sure that good practices are being followed.  Have not noticed any changes. Please make sure the teams know what the latest requirements are as far as what we need to put in the chart, as these requirements seem to change a bit (for instance, what drugs have been tried and failed) @all Have you personally noticed improvements in the process and timing recently?  Secondly, any specific recommendations you might suggest to improve the experience? Making point people for contact has been key. Previously we had several different providers placing these tubes, but they all had various levels of comfort with the tubes themselves. Now becoming a point person from a procedural standpoint has greatly improved communication and direction of the program.  I agree with Sandeep. There are metrics regarding this process that would certainly be quantifiable from an external review board to qualify a team or center as a COE. Would be very beneficial to patients (and our respective institutions) if these centers are recognized and also made available through AbbVie's promotional literature to increase visibility of these programs and increase referral patterns. @all These are some great comments already.  Adding on the ones listed, can any one else think of other enhancements in their treatment team, or differences that changed in their program since they started and have been beneficial?   Example, a new way of enrolling the patient, new communication system between offices, educating patients, etc. The challenges were mostly local regulatory and insurance.  The same challenges we have for every therapy.  The main challenge I face is convincing patients to get the procedure done. Once it is implanted, almost all patients are very happy. We have no major efficiency issues on our treatment team.  I think the best thing is putting them in touch with another patient who has Duopa and also letting them know that it is not permanent - if they don't like the tube it can always be removed. This often helps convince them. thanks for the comments Avram Fraint Carolyn Taylor, anything you have changed in the way you have presented this therapy to patients over time? I think we were organized from the beginning. Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD identified an interested GI specialist early. It probably helped being involved in the clinical trial. 
The only thing that I have become better at is writing what is necessary for insurance approval in my epic notes. This makes the process more efficient.  We had to get better at the insurance approvals. At first we were not sure what criteria was needed in order to be approved, but now that we now it makes the process much faster.  Picking Friday's as a designated procedure day for these procedures and the following monday appointment for dose titration with the nurse educator at the Movement Disorder Team. Early on, we made sure that the scheduling piece works well and the credit for that goes to Pam Salas and my Clinic Facilitator and our IR scheduling team . This is truly the critical piece. Now we do not require any clinical support for placement so that is one less thing to coordinate. This used to be a challenge early on.  Finding an interventional radiologist who is willing to reposition the J-tube has been a major help for us.  It is much easier to get patients into IR than it is to get them into the OR for an endoscopic procedure.  Thus, patients are treated more quickly by IR and they can therefore get back on their medication sooner.  This has drastically improved our efficiency compared to when we first started out.  I agree convincing patient's to move forward with Duopa is a challenge. I think there is some selection bias in this as many patients who would benefit from Duopa the most have already foregone other treatment options earlier in their disease (like other medications, or sometimes DBS), so they are probably more reluctant to try new therapies in general. The main challenge I face is convincing patients to get the procedure done. Once it is implanted, almost all patients are very happy. We have no major efficiency issues on our treatment team. I haven't felt that we've met any major challenges. It helps that our treatment team is all located in the same building, and we are all Northwestern providers able to communicate through the same EMR.  Agreed - it helps for patients to hear success stories. Emphasizing reversibility has been helpful for some patients as well. I think the best thing is putting them in touch with another patient who has Duopa and also letting them know that it is not permanent - if they don't like the tube it can always be removed. This often helps convince them. I think having centers of excellence (COE) for Duopa therapy will allow patients to be aware that Duopa therapy is something of substance. The therapy has accolades to it which patients can better grasp its importance. Enrolling patients would be easier because they seek out these COE @all These are some great comments already.  Adding on the ones listed, can any one else think of other enhancements in their treatment team, or differences that changed in their program since they started and have been beneficial?   Example, a new way of enrolling the patient, new communication system between offices, educating patients, etc. I agree with Tom Davis that insurances affect efficiency. Tubing problems from Non-abbvie products caused some delays and limited Abbvie from troubleshooting issues since ""it wasn't Abbvie tubing"". Finding the best proceduralist i can see is an issue that other centers may have.  thanks for the comments Avram Fraint, MD, MS Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC, anything you have changed in the way you have presented this therapy to patients over time? I agree convincing patient's to move forward with Duopa is a challenge.

As far as improving ways to present patients with the Duopa options, I agree with Avram Fraint, MD, MS as far as the importance of established Duopa patients speaking with potential Duopa patients.
Making sure patients know the stoma is reversible, the therapy does not have to be used at all times, if they prefer to not show the pump during a special event, all need to be emphasized                The account executive, DuoConnect Complete, and nurse educator    The Nurse Educator program has been invaluable to me and my practice and rely on them for support and guidance. Ryan Trumpinski has been tremendous and an invaluable resource. My lack of knowledge of some of these programs have been completely supplanted by Carolyn, Avram, and Ryan as well which is the great part about working with such a knowledgeable team. This was very easy to adopt into my practice because these mechanisms were already in place.  The account executive and the website have been most helpful.  @all How can your local Duopa Representative be more helpful?  The nurse ambassador and peer mentor.  The nurse educator is extremely useful for the provider during titration visits. The patients find the nurse ambassador early on in their treatment. We typically use our own patients/care partners as resources for those interested in pursing Duopa.  Duoconnect for both myself and the patients.  Nurse ambassador and Duoconnect most useful  The most helpful resources from my view are the nurse ambassador and the peer mentor program. Since launching the nurse ambassador program my patients seem to have much more familiarity with the Duopa pump when they come in for their titration date. Although we have a number of Duopa patients at NM whom our potential Duopa patients can speak to, I like to use the peer ambassador program to get a better demographic match for potential Duopa patients (i.e., young male patient can speak with another young male, female patient can speak with another female)  where do i start Brad ??? Just kidding. The rep can be doing more community education programs at support groups (when things open up) but also support be allowed to educate patients and family at the visits without limitations based on how many people are there. @all How can your local Duopa Representative be more helpful? Account Exec for me personally but for patients it has to be the nurse ambassador  For patients Duoconnect and nurse ambassador as well as peer mentor are very useful
For me the account executive, nurse educator, have been very helpful "
283,Duopa Treatment Teams,"The largest issue has been the ability to schedule ""elective"" admission for tube placement. I have been able to get around this since I admit them post-procedure for observation which is allowed and that has been able to keep our work-flow relatively steady without too much obstruction, but patient's fears regarding hospitalization play a part in this as well.  This is very interesting. In my experience, patient who opt for DBS over Duopa are much more likely to go ahead with surgery now rather than wait until the pandemic is over.  I think the DBS patients are generally less concerned about risk. It has not changed the way I talk to patients.  I think elective surgery is  no more risky than going to the grocery store.  I have not changed the way I talk to patients about the procedures, but I do warn them that the typical timeline is likely to be prolonged during the pandemic.  I agree with the previous comments and have not changed my practices.  I do assure people who may be hesitant that precautions are in place.  Every patient is covid tested prior to procedures.  I haven't changed my view of elective procedures but certain patients have voiced their concern and preference to wait until the pandemic is over/calmed down.  I think it just depends on the patient and what they are comfortable with.  We have a mandate with the second bad phase of the virus, to not schedule elective procedures that could potentially lead to a hosptial observation. So far we have not had any patients with the Duopa Tube placement who may have needed immediate post procedure hospitalization. 

Yes we do counsel them regarding the hospital COVID-19 POLICIES and they also have to get a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours of the procedure, that needs to be resulted &lt;72 hours. Just like if you are trying to hop on a plane to go to Hawaii from the northwest or the west coast!  Not really… Patients are required to undergo preoperative COVID-19 testing 72 hours before the procedure, and they are then asked to quarantine during the intervening days between the test and the procedure.  I now ask my patients on the morning of any operation or procedure whether they have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or if they have had any symptoms over the past few days.  Fortunately, the rate of nosocomial spread seems to be virtually nil, so I try to assure patients that the chances of them actually getting Covid from a brief outpatient visit to the hospital is quite low.  I haven't changed my view of elective procedures, I would be interested to hear what Harold Boutte, Jr, MD 's view is. 

I have had several patients interested in Duopa who have suggested delaying the PEG-J to a later date, sometimes for fear about the pandemic, and sometimes for personal reasons. I have counseled these patients that in the past, elective procedures have been cancelled or delayed at NM, so this should be taken into consideration as a potential cause for delays in the future, even when the patient decides they are ready.  Not much has changed as patients can get COVID testing prior to surgery. I have asked patients to be patient in the process as the guidelines are ever changing with elective procedures. There are those that we recommend get surgery done sooner based on their medical condition, however others we have been guiding them to think about after the vaccinations are more readily available if they are nervous about the pandemic.  There are patients who prefer not to have the procedure done at this time because of the pandemic. I think that is reasonable. Of course we tell them that Rush has all kinds of safety measures in place, including COVID testing. From a provider perspective I have not changed how I discuss these procedures  Given my background in internal medicine and specifically GI, I feel comfortable fielding the questions regarding movement disorders and their effect on GI motility as well as describing medication absorption through the jejunum as well from a drug kinetic perspective.

What would be VERY helpful is an overview of the pump itself and the programming so I can be more knowledgeable about how the run times, boluses and alarms to help with trouble shooting. These questions are invariably deferred to Carolyn Taylor and Avram Fraint, however I still  receive these questions from patients regardless. Caitlin Houghton Sanjiv Parikh Sandeep Thakkar Richard A Pierce Harold Boutte, Jr These are great insights, thank you Dr. Houghton.  Often times for new surgeons placing the tubing, they don't have as much awareness of the disease / therapy when starting placing the tubing.  In your experience and opinion, would it be helpful for proceduralists to have more education of the disease / therapy from the beginning to assist in those conversations with the patient?  I certainly know the neurologists are having these conversations, but it seems patients ask each physician about the therapy etc. Thanks to both Avram and Carolyn, when they see me they are more than well informed regarding Duopa, and typically have specific questions about the tube itself (i.e. How it's placed, recovery time, day-to-day care, need for replacement, etc.). These are very common question that I field when placing tubes in general so as a provider it keeps me within my sphere of expertise without having to over extend myself by answering questions I'm not comfortable with. Caitlin Houghton Sanjiv Parikh Richard A Pierce Harold Boutte, Jr - Do patients ask you specific questions geared towards Duopa &amp; Parkinson's disease? I was trained by Dr. Adam Stein, who previously placed the majority of Duopa tubes here at NMH and I took over as the lead for placing these tubes this past year.  I treat patients with Parkinson's disease.  If you do that, you should be proficient in the therapies for PD.  Duopa is a therapy for PD, so I am involved.  Caitlin Houghton, MD Sanjiv Parikh, MD, DRM Richard A Pierce, MD, PhD Harold Boutte, Jr, MD - Do patients ask you specific questions geared towards Duopa &amp; Parkinson's disease? Dr. Thakkar approached me to see if I would help with tube placement in 2017 and we have been working together ever since. During my fellowship training at Rush I focused and was trained on DBS. At Rush, similar to my current position at Northwestern, the DBS team was also responsible for all infusion based therapies, and so this was included as part of my training as well. When I arrived at Northwestern I soon took over the advanced therapeutics program along with Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC which covers essentially all interventional therapies for PD.  Dr. Thakkar approached me to see if I would help with tube placement in 2017 and we have been working together ever since.  They do, But I always start the consultation by saying that Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. and I work closely together to get them the best treatment possible.  That his role is to decide if they are a good candidate for the medication administered by this route and my role is to make sure the tube is placed safely.  This tends to defer most of the Parkinson's related questions back to his office.  They tend to ask if this will help their symptoms and have I seen improvement in patients.  I tend to answer that question by saying yes I do believe it significantly helps patients.  I don't get to see the full effects but I do know that very few patients take the tube out electively and patients who have an issue with the tube and need replacement are eager to get back to the infusion. Caitlin Houghton Sanjiv Parikh Richard A Pierce Harold Boutte, Jr - Do patients ask you specific questions geared towards Duopa &amp; Parkinson's disease? Usually hesitancy is due to unfamiliarity.  On the proceduralist side, it is important that my nursing staff feel comfortable with the tube and its parts in order to answer patient concerns or to help troubleshoot issues.  I have made sure my nurses know how to replace the parts on the outer tube and know common issues that can occur... tube leaks especially if the tube is over 2 years old...Disconnection of the J-tube from the y connector.  This allows them to feel they have the expertise to be a valuable member. Anything you would say to a potential treatment team member who might be hesitant about being part of the Duopa team?  Caitlin Houghton Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis Avram Fraint Honestly I probably could use a quick overview of the basics so that I am somewhat knowledgeable.  Maybe that would be a good addition to our next dinner meeting! Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. can give a brief presentation on Parkinson's and the reasons why patients are good candidates and I can give a short presentation on the procedure itself so all team members have a baseline knowledge of both components. Caitlin Houghton Sanjiv Parikh Sandeep Thakkar Richard A Pierce Harold Boutte, Jr These are great insights, thank you Dr. Houghton.

I certainly know the neurologists are having these conversations, but it seems patients ask each physician about the therapy etc. Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. Yes you are always invited! Caitlin Houghton sounds like that would be great for our next meeting to have a discussion of these points. Maybe i can actually attend the procedure to get a perspective from start to finish. I have been directly involved in the interventional program at Rush University for 7 years. It was only natural to include Duopa as one of the treatment options I would offer to patients with advanced PD.  As long as the members of the team have clear roles and there is good communication between teams (neurology and GI) managing Duopa patients is not a burden. We have many patients who have been on this therapy for many years who have been stable. The support from Abbvie is also excellent! Anything you would say to a potential treatment team member who might be hesitant about being part of the Duopa team?  Caitlin Houghton Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis Avram Fraint I was hired for the surgical intervention team at Rush.  I was approached directly by our our Movement disorder physician and I readily agreed as I recognized very quickly that this would help the patient. Moreover, we had participated with our GI team before in the Freka Tube Trial. We did have significant challenges with combined scheduling and moreover, some technical issues leading to the coaxial jejunostomy tube being pulled back and coiled in the stomach, because of the 'Angle of entry' of the percutaneous G tube tract. The patients were coming back for J tube repositioning. But after IR has taken over with both placement of the Pull through G tube and the coaxial tube, we have had no problems. This has also made scheduling very easy.  It also helped to see some remarkable results early on in the Freka Tube Trial.  As per my previous answer, I was approached directly by the movement disorder team to assist with placing the tubes.  Actually, technically, a colleague of mine was approached, but he was already spread to thin to take on the additional clinical volume, so he passed along to me.  I am certainly quite thankful for this as it has become a very nice niche practice for me.  I was specifically hired to help with care of patients in our advanced therapeutics program (DBS and Duopa)  I think Duopa outcomes speak for themselves. Seeing a patient before and after Duopa is a good way to get buy-in from team members about the significant quality of life improvement that is possible with Duopa.

I would say my involvement began with the FDA approval of Duopa. As a movement specialist this was an expected requirement to offer this to patients. There was a lot of time required to get trained and be informed but completely worth it based on outcomes  Anything you would say to a potential treatment team member who might be hesitant about being part of the Duopa team?

Tom Davis and I both come from a training program where 'continuous dopaminergic stimulation' was touted as a therapy decades before Duopa came out, so this therapy was something we had been waiting for. We did the pivotal study and then just moved on to the commercial therapy.  I would say 'live a little'. I bet in most places these teams are the most fun to work with! Anything you would say to a potential treatment team member who might be hesitant about being part of the Duopa team?  Caitlin Houghton Jessica Karl Carolyn Taylor Tom Davis Avram Fraint From a GI perspective, we have an advanced team here that helps place/manage tubes and this was a tube type that we were able to adopt into our program thanks to the support from Neurology and also the Abbvie Nurse Educators who helped further train us as providers and help with our patients knowledge base as well.  The most important aspect of getting started is having a surgical partner who has a real interest in the program.   We are very fortunate at Vanderbilt to have excellent surgical support so the challenges of the tube for neurology are very minimal.  Outside problems with the tube, Duopa is very simple. All movement disorders neurologist should be experts in adjusting L-DOPA so all there is to learn about Duopa is the pump and that is why there are ""cheat sheets"".  Dayanna Ocegueda Carolyn Taylor, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-BC Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD Avram Fraint, MD, MS Tom Davis What is the process when you need to fill or backfill a role?  Who will get that individual up to speed with the Duopa process?  When I arrived at Northwestern there was a process already in place. Since I took over the advanced therapeutics program we have continued the same workflow.  Sandeep Thakkar, D.O. is the one who identified the initial need in our area for Duopa for Parkinson's patients. Once I was brought on board, our nurse leads did a lot of the work to establish the work flow.  They talk frequently to each other to ensure the process is smooth.  In addition the neuro nurse manager has my direct contact to quickly make me aware of any tube issues that may come up after insertion.  At Rush University Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD started/drove the process. He was involved in the clinical trial. Once the process was started our entire team (Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD , Dayanna Ocegueda, myself, GI team) worked together to perfect the process.  I agree with Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C and Leonard Verhagen, MD, PhD. At this point I feel our numbers are pretty well represented. We have a good process in place to keep things running smooth. Everyone does their role well.  I provide the training and I ask for help from the DuoConnect nurse. Dayanna Ocegueda Carolyn Taylor Jessica Karl Leonard Verhagen Avram Fraint Tom Davis What is the process when you need to fill or backfill a role?  Who will get that individual up to speed with the Duopa process? This was initiated by our Movement disorder team and once they talked to me , I felt that this was a very worthy procedure for helping patients with refractory Parkinson's. We had a meeting followed by discussion of the logistics and then we got inserviced on the tube and also got connected with Abbvie Rep and clinical support. Now we are on our own doing procedures without anybody's support from Abbvie, Inc.  I believe that the initial development was champion by Tom Davis.  I was asked by their group to join as the proceduralist, and we all had a day-long meeting and training session at a local hotel back in 2015, I think.  Adding in our surgical nurse practitioners was a fairly natural transition, and they really are the glue that holds my practice together.  I was also lucky enough to identify a first, and then a second, interventional radiologist who have had family members with Parkinson's disease and have been very invested in helping me with repositioning J-tubes under fluoroscopy, as long as the G-tube is intact.  The NPs in neurology, surgery, and interventional radiology do a lot of the initial communications as they tend to be a bit more available on a daily basis, and it really helps keep the whole system flowing nicely.  Our previous physician overseeing the advanced therapeutics program at Northwestern helped develop the workflow - based on a similar workflow model in our DBS program.  On the neuro side I provide the training, and I have also utilized our Abbvie rep to help with education about Duopa and the process in general Dayanna Ocegueda Carolyn Taylor Jessica Karl Leonard Verhagen Avram Fraint Tom Davis What is the process when you need to fill or backfill a role?  Who will get that individual up to speed with the Duopa process? We had a need for advanced therapies for our patients. Abbvie reps helped foster such relationships between my group and surgeons. I can say our team was fortunate being in private practice to partner closely with GI surgeons and interventional radiologists who were willing to be available for this specific patient population.  @jessica is correct, as usual. I was site PI for the pivotal study and from there transitioned to commercial use. The crucial step was to find a GI specialist interested in collaborating and we found him relatively quickly. He has been the only one performing tube placements and his team is responsive to our requests and our patients. For example, patients can send them a picture of their tube site if they are concerned about leakage, discoloration etcetera. As Tom Davis mentioned, Duopa is not difficult and if there is a good 'tube partner' the process is smooth. The next big help was Tony, AbbVie's nurse specialist. He coordinated our team form the beginning until we were more or less on autopilot. Finally Dayanna Ocegueda our MA has become the 'mobilizer' who communicates with AbbVie, GI, Neurology and patient. She requires cloning.  Dayanna Ocegueda (mobilizer extraordinaire)  knows the process best and she has left detailed instructions for our nurse for when she is not in the office. And we will lean more on our account executive and Duoconnect when she is out. I provide the training and I ask for help from the DuoConnect nurse. Nothing. The Nurse educators were amazing and even cam to NMH to give me a tutorial on the tube itself as a re-fresher course before I started placing more of these tubes in my practice.  We were fortunate to have excellent surgical support from the beginning so I am not sure I would have done anything differently.  I think more formal training in managing the pump would have been useful.  I think it went quite smooth at Rush University but I owe that to Dayanna Ocegueda for being extremely organized. Our Duopa RN (Tony D.) at the time was also very helpful it coordinating the care between GI and movement.  I wouldn't have done anything different. With the help from the Abbvie team we were able to make a smooth transition.  We are blessed with a very good well oiled machine between the Nurse coordinator at the Movement Disorder Clinic and my scheduling MA. I just got off the phone and talked to Pam Salas and asked her how are things going from IR's end,  and she said one word 'Fabulous' . There are certain situations where the patient post placement and post initiation of treatment have some tube malfunction issues, either having a hard time flushing or getting a 'high pressure' signal, then they call 'Duopa Connect' and the 'Nurse Coordinator' at the Movement disorder clinic. They in turn let us know and we get on the 'tube Maintainenance and Check' either same day or next day.  I probably would have identified one or more colleagues in interventional radiology sooner.  Early on, when patients had J tubes that became displaced, I was taking the back to the operating room to reposition the tubes endoscopically.  This not only became a little challenging for me from a scheduling standpoint, but it also resulted in an additional anesthetic and OR time for the patient.  Having the J-tube was repositioned under fluoroscopy in the IR suite with no anesthesia has been a real benefit.  I'm overall happy with our Treatment team. We've had smooth transitions between 3 different GI docs and 2 different neurologists so I think the workflow is pretty successful.  I don't think we would be doing much differently but it has been good to have a person or our point of contact who can have communication with the Gi team's point of contact. The relationship between proceduralist and MDS is key in that they can pick up the phone, text, email, etc to discuss cases in a timely manner. If there were case conferences monthly that may help as well.  I agree with both comments that Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C made  I would argue that the Nurse Educator plays an important role in the team list and should play a standard role to facilitate Abbvie communication between patient and providers.  At Vanderbilt all of the movement providers inject botulinum toxin, and manage patients on DBS, Duopa, and apomorphine. All patients who are candidates for both Duopa and DBS are offered both therapies.  I think patients are more willing to consider ""advanced therapies"" if they can keep the provider with whom they have a long term relationship.  NP/PA s in movement disorders and general surgery have been very helpful in managing the urgencies that can occur with advanced therapies.  Everyone on our team is reflected on the resource, though in some situations patients may wish to continue with their initial movement disorders specialist rather than see me exclusively.  I am on the proceduralist side.  Once we get a consult for Duopa PEG-J.  My NP and GI lab scheduler are in frequent contact with both our AbbVie rep and the neurologist clinic Nurse Manager to arrange scheduling once medications are approved.  Aside from the members already listed I would also include the Duopa team RN who helps the neurology provider in clinic with the titration process.  I agree with Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C. Our Abbvie nurse educator is part of every titration visit.  In our setting, the Movement Disorder Clinic contacts my IR Clinic scheduler and sends a consult note to substantiate it. 
We then see the patient in the Clinic , where we complete the preprocedure evaluation and clinical exam. We also review any pertinent imaging and if need be request more imaging to ensure 'safe window' for the procedure. We only see patients in the clinic who have preauthorization for Duopa Treatment. The patient then gets scheduled usually in a 1 to 2 week time frame with anesthesia in the IR suite. We do our best to accomodate patient and Movement Disorder requests, i.e : we have successfully performed the procedure on a patient seen in the Clinic on a tuesday morning and procedure performed same friday morning.  I will echo Tom Davis and Caitlin Houghton, MD.  I fortunately have 2 excellent nurse practitioners in my surgical clinic who see all of the AbbVie patients.  If the patients are particularly complex in terms of prior abdominal surgery, I will generally see them as well in clinic prior to their tube placement.  However, if they have had minimal or no prior abdominal surgery and seem relatively straightforward, the NPs will just put them on my surgical schedule and I will meet the patient on the day of the procedure.

Postoperatively, the NPs also play an important role, as patients that have tube malfunctions will first come to the clinic to be evaluated by them.  They have all the necessary hardware in clinic so that they can replace connectors and reinsert J tubes that have pulled out to a small degree.  If the J-tube is pulled out a significant amount, the NPs will order a KUB, and then often refer the patient to our interventional radiologist, if needed.  At Northwestern, all Duopa patients are referred to a particular neurologist (Avram Fraint) to take over their management if they proceed with Duopa. Although Dr. Fraint takes over the care of Duopa patients, the referring movement disorders specialists do continue to be involved in decision making/answering questions about Duopa until the patient actually proceeds with the PEG-J procedure. The patient's established movement disorders specialist can often be critical in the patient's decision to actually move forward with Duopa.  Our neurology clinic runs similar to the treatment team roles. We have not seen the Duopa RN for years, and I think that is a shame that there is not additional services at certain centers. Patients require such a standardization.  This is interesting, thanks for the comment Tom Davis .  Regarding your comment about patients being more willing to consider ""advanced therapies"" if they can keep their provider.  Would you think patients that are referred from a General Neuro to a MDS are more reluctant to start an advanced therapy as they may not be as easily managed by their GN or provider they have a long term relationship with?  Would they be more comfortable if they knew that they were simply going to the movement disorder center to have the therapy completed and then return to their long standing physician? At Vanderbilt all of the movement providers inject botulinum toxin, and manage patients on DBS, Duopa, and apomorphine. All patients who are candidates for both Duopa and DBS are offered both therapies.  I think patients are more willing to consider ""advanced therapies"" if they can keep the provider with whom they have a long term relationship.  NP/PA s in movement disorders and general surgery have been very helpful in managing the urgencies that can occur with advanced therapies. During in-clinic titration I like to have the AbbVie nurse educator be part of the team.
At Rush, we have a different model than the one described by Tom Davis. Within our movement disorder practice patients are referred for Duopa mostly to Jessica Karl, PhD, PA-C and me. After they are stabilized they often stay with us, but some like the option of going back to their original provider and come and see us when there is a specific infusion issue. Some alternate visits between us and the original person. "
