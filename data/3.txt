The patient not only get the instructions for use,  tool for logging fingersticks but a few free needles for the pen.  They act like they hit the jackpot.  I have never used starter kits with patient.  Yes any type of kits are great.  To me a kit represents that it contains everything in it to make you successful.  I believe it's a receipt for success.  However they have to be message to the patient the right way.  It does depend on the product and very patient-dependent.  A starter kit allows the patient to get comfortable with the use of the product and allows them to see what they need for daily use because it is all right there for them.  Depends on the product and the patient but in general I think they help with success, at least initially. Follow-through and long term success is always a challenge. Perhaps it would be helpful to have the patients include their information and there could be a touch point at 3 and 6 months later from Abbott.  Depends on the patient
